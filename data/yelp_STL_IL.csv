The Nashville Fried Chicken is so so delicious. It came with cole slaw, pickles, buns and 2 pieces of chicken. The chicken is moist, the skin is crispy is well-seasoned. The cole slaw goes really well with the spiciness of the chicken. 
Ramen: I would not say this is authentic ramen. Does not mean it is not good. It's just Asian-infused and more Westernized. Both steak ramen and chicken ramen are flavorful. The only thing I had to rate them down because they are both way too salty. I had to pour out all the broth in the bowl, put hot water in twice and it was still salty.

I came across bestbridalprices.com but was skeptical about buying online due to horror stories I've read about. I did some research on the company and the designer of my dress (Sottero & Midgeley by Maggie Sottero) and found that the website was a ""premier authorized dealer"". The website is linked to the physical store called Frew's Bridal in Alton, IL. 

The price was the best that I found anywhere in the Chicago area by at least $400, not to mention they were running a deal to get a free veil up to $100 and free shoes up to $50 and free shipping (although there are restrictions on the designers to choose from). A pretty good deal that can save a decent amount of money! The ordering process was fairly easy as well, although I didn't have an area to provide comments or specify a hollow to hem size, which would have been nice since the dress fits perfectly except the length is way too long. The shipping was way faster than estimated!!! I ordered March 31st and it wasn't scheduled to be delivered until July, but it came at the beginning of June!! I know these have a lot to do with the designer, but the dress goes to the store first to be checked before being shipped to the customer, so still great turn-around time. When I received the dress, there were 2 small areas where the stitching was loose. I called the store in the required timeframe and they didn't hesitate to let me return it to have it fixed by the designer. I declined, opting to have my seamstress fix it when she shortens the dress, since it was very small fixes and my parents were visiting soon and I really wanted my mom to see the dress since it would be the only chance before the wedding next year. 

I have 2 complaints. First, the veil was delivered in a round plastic container and it was kind of folded in, so I'm going to have to mold it to shape to my head or it will be sticking out every which way. I wish they would ship them in a container where the whole thing can lay somewhat flat. Second, the shoes I ordered were 1/2 size too small (my big toes hung over the edge a bit). I tried to exchange them since I didn't wear them anywhere and they were still in the packaging in perfect condition, but they wouldn't do it. I even took extra time looking at similar shoes and sizes to try to get it right the first time, but you can never 100% get it right with different brands. I think this was completely unreasonable and stupid - so make sure to pick the right size. At least they were free, but I wouldn't order the right size from them since I don't want to chance that those could possibly still be the wrong size and not be able to exchange or return them.

Overall, great company to work with minus the whole shoe debacle.",2013-10-10 02:23:05

Being one of the cheapest Wyndham hotels in the St. Louis area, I thought I'd give this Super 8 a shot. 

Checking in was fine, but as soon as I got to the stairwell, I noticed a very musty smell. The second floor hallway wreaked of smoke, even though smoking was supposedly not allowed. 

The room gave mixed impressions. The bed was nice, but the closest power outlet was literally attached to the wall with a piece of scotch tape. I tried plugging my phone in for a charge and it kept falling out. 

Checkout was very slow. Usually Wyndham properties allow express checkout, but not here. After waiting for about 15 minutes, the lady at the desk prints my receipt, only to walk away and say she'll be right back. I guess she went to check that the room was left in good enough condition to return the security deposit. Either way, it was one of the slowest checkouts I've ever had.

I wanted to share the information I searched about this company on Ripoff.com and USA.gov. As many of you did, I received their mail today (July 26, 2014) and something raised a big red flag on my mind as soon as I read their letter - no company logo, too many words in bold and italic. I became curious and googled the company's address and found some nasty information that should impact your decision. I posted a snapshot of their letter for your reference.

They are a little higher price than the other.   First tray wasn't wiped down thoroughly, second was slightly damp. 

Second.   They didn't have shredded  lettuce for tacos.    Husband prefers that to eat with salad.

Third the waitress was working quite a few tables, where there was another waitress who was waiting very few tables and was barely doing that.

Now recall this was a Saturday night, so it was quite busy.     

We even asked if our waitress if they were over worked and she stated just me.

The lady who was waiting on us was so overwhelmed that she ended up quitting.

My husband mentioned that the one lady wasn't doing anything and the other was over worked, she basically said that the just started at 5 pm.   

Granted people might have less tables if they worked longer, however the difference in amount of tables were greatly different and she basically was dismissive of my husband.     Since she walked off.

Oh and the person who was supposed to take over her tables never got us anything else to drink.

So I had to drink from my husband's glass.

I drove down here from Pontoon Beach/Granite City (25 minute drive), because the DMV in Granite and in Edwardsville both have a lot of horrible reviews on google. Each time I went there, and signed in, I was promptly helped by a competent and clear person. The entire process was pretty painless. The place seemed well organized and the staff seemed interested in doing a good job, and helping things flow along. When new people came in, someone would check on whether they had signed in and were at the right window. The personalities of the people who helped me varied a bit, one guy was pretty low key and reserved, a woman was bubbly and cheerful, etc. But everyone was polite and respectful. 

There is a LOT of documentation you need to bring if you move from out of state and want to get a license in Illinois. Includes proof of SS#, Identification, two documents proving Illinois residence, and another proof. I brought a SS card, Drivers License, a bank statement and a bill both sent to my current IL address and that was sufficient. But you need to check carefully the website to make sure you bring the right things for whatever you want to get done. If you want to get your Illinois plates, don't forget your title (forgot that the first time - needed to go back). If you don't have the right documentation, there is not much they can do for you. The good news is that they know what is needed and are willing to explain it to you clearly and politely, and once you have what you need, they do everything with you.

After they filled in the required paperwork on their computers, they printed it out for me to check. There were minor errors at some times (e.g., one person got the county of Granite City wrong) so I 'm glad they were very patient about this and glad that I checked carefully. 

The drivers test on the computer is kind of a joke how easy it is. Questions sort of seemed like ""is it okay to drive while intoxicated""? or asking you to identify a stop sign. But it was sort of fun to review these basic things. 

When you get your license, they ask you if you want to be registered to vote. This is a nice touch and I appreciated getting these done at once. 

Going to the DMV is certainly not a highlight of anyone's life, but at this office, at least, the experience was pleasant enough and I felt like state dollars weren't going to waste. 

One more thing: based on the pictures everywhere, the current Secretary of State kinda looks like OJ Simpson!",2016-08-13 00:15:07

Rebekah greeted me with open arms and showed me around to all the different areas for the things I was looking for. I needed furniture within the next three days delivered and as long as I was okay with taking a floor model they promised to get it to me two days later (which they did). The prices were great and Mueller's is very good with haggling and throwing in perks.

I ended up getting three bedroom sets, a dining room table, kitchen table and living room set delivered to me in two days. The delivery guys were great and polite and stayed in contact with me so that I knew the precise time that they would arrive (perfect for those who need to do errands in the interim).

I'll gladly make the trek from south city to O'Fallon to get this delicious, superior and value Thai.

Having been twice, I am ashamed to admit that I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles so I have had that each visit, albeit once chicken and once pork.

The appetizers are delicious.  Have tried the spring rolls, chicken satay and chicken pot-stickers and they were all satisfying.

The waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish.  They ask you on a scale of 1 to 4.  First visit I asked for 3 and the dish was very nice.  Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a ""sinus opening experience"" the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.

The menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being ""not fresh"" I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I've had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.

Each visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.

Walk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.

I've been to Thailand a few times and while you'll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.  It's where I'll be taking my out-of-town guests and where I'll go for takeout when the urge hits. 

Looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their menu choices...unless those Drunken Noodles get me again!",2013-01-28 17:33:26

I went in with high expectations and was sadly disappointed.  I gave this place two visits just in case the first time was just an off day. 
Allow me to explain!  Heading out for work, I had a craving for donuts. I typically do not eat sweets so early but chocolate glazed sounded good. Read good reviews and had to see for myself. Well, place is nothing  spectacular.   I was expecting full racks, shelves and trays stacked with goodies and glass display cabinets filled with cakes of all sorts. What I saw, instead, were half empty racks, table of cookies had few selections and atmosphere did not have the great aroma of a fresh bakery. And to top it off, my cashier very young lady was not that friendly. Did not even make eye contact as she accepted my payment.  Like I said, maybe just an off day! 
So I return another day. And, this time it was in the afternoon. Did not see another customer so I figured quick service. Well, three employees were there talking fairly loud. One acknowledged my presence and gave me a greeting. She had to get through two other employees deep in their loud conversation. The lady taking my order had to asked me twice what I said.  She would apologize for not hearing me the first time as she also apologized for the loud noise coming from the other two.  I got my order and went on my way. 
The donuts are ok.  I could buy from grocery store and be just as satisfied. I would visit again just to try other items. I do support local family businesses so give this place a try.",2018-09-26 22:42:49

Think Rothman prices with Ashley Furniture pieces. Not a Broyhill in sight. 

Negatives:
- Entertainment centers and TV stand selection is small, and over priced selection.
-Their ""Clearance"" section is laughable and not much of a sale. No one is going to pay $299 for a nicked up coffee table that was originally $350. Go lower. 
- Sectionals by themselves average around $1,000 by brands I've never heard of. 
- The staff hangs out like a clique chatting in the middle of the store rather than helping customers. 
-Dining sets are nothing special and overpriced as well. I've seen the same selection everywhere else at a lower price. 
-5% military discount? Ooooh you're going to knock $20 off my sofa! 

Only Positive:
-They have a few modern pieces.

Now the bad...
Cons: I ordered the Fried chicken sliders and it was a chicken nugget on a bun twice it's size. Also both types of fries were unseasoned. Also no children's menu.

My husband and I were puzzled by this because we see buffets as way of sampling menu and then come back and order pulled pork sandwich at dinner time but that is what she explained.

All in all we will be back for the wings and possibly lunch buffet.",2016-06-01 01:46:04

I called and spoke with the manager Lori  who had the audacity to tell me I ""had to understand their point of view"" and if ""I chose to be difficult"" she wouldn't help me.

I went here for the 2007 NASFiC which was also Archon for the year and was simply unimpressed with the space. It's sad because I really would have liked it. 

The first thing is that it's located in the middle of freakin' nowhere from the point of view of someone who isn't from around those parts. It's about 30 minutes out of town, with no direct way to get there except for SuperShuttle, which costs a ton. A Taxi will run you 'OH MY GOD!"" and if you try to take the lightrail you're a fool. Just a fool. 

Now, once you're there, there's everything you need to keep yourself from experience too much of the world outside the convention center area. There are varying levels of restaurant within walking distance and a dozen or so hotels. I stayed at the Drury Inn. There's a Mexican place, whcih is OK, and there's a White Castle, which I put a hurt on the first day I was there. There's a lovely Rudy Tuesday, and after years of seeing their commercials in a state that has no Ruby Tuesday, I was glad to get to see one in person. 

The real problem is the Convention Centre itself. The rooms are weirdly set-up and I had a real problem finding the rooms where the various programmes were. The signage was poor and at a couple of points it seemed to indicate that the same room was in two different places. The thing could handle a good-sized con, but it also had some serious bottlenecks that you don't have to deal with at the best CCs.",2008-08-25 18:08:14

Now for the attractions.  There is this wave machine called ""Flow Rider"" in which you get up on a surfboard.  That was way cool!  Monsoon Mountain is the bucket attraction that pours water on you, and there are water slides as well.

Tony & Courtney arrived at 9:00 on the dot (said B/T 9-10) and were ready to go! To expedite things, I had sectional couch disassembled as well as bed and most everything ready as possible.  They came in with clean blankets, wrapped everything then followed that up with shrink wrap to each article taken into the truck. 

They were both most professional in appearance, experience, attitude, manners, correspondence and work ethic. Had the truck loaded in almost no time (very efficient), and were punctual in arriving at new residence as well.  Unloading was just as easy and could not have expected anything more from these two gentlemen. 

Lost count of the number of times they offered to move a specific item to exact location and set things a certain way. That has not been my experience with moving companies in the past. 

Based on phone conversation when scheduling the appointment, the quote was spot on regarding the time it would take, if not less. 

It is worth a bit extra in saved time and piece of mind by hiring professionals (if within budget), versus renting a truck and utilizing friends..  

This was the first time using this company and glad we did!

I explained to her kind of what I wanted (blonde highlights) then told her about my hard water. She said she had a plan for me and would love to do caramel since my water is so hard. I let her do what she thought was best (usually I wouldn't), but she seemed to know what she was talking about and was VERY VERY confident in her job. I trusted her and walked out of the salon feeling fabulous. She did such an amazing job and I have never gotten so many compliments on my hair.  I love the confidence that she had and she was so personable. If I lived closer I would go back in a heartbeat.

We rented a limo for a bachelor party on Friday December 27th. 
The day I booked the rental they charged my debit card $100 deposit. 
I received a confirmation via email with pick up address and confirmed via email. 
The driver was to pick us up at 830PM.  At 9PM I started calling the main number I booked the reservation through.  I talked to a guy who said he would call me right back he had to find the driver.  After 20 minutes i called back.  No answer. 
I then navigated through the entire phone tree by pressing numerous prompts and finally got an emergency number.  I called that number and got Pam. She said she would find the driver.  Again the same story.  She called back 10 minutes later and said they had to cancel, could not find the driver!  How does a company not know where their drivers are?  How can a company just decide to cancel one hour after they are supposed to be there?  There was no apology in her voice.  Just sorry had to cancel.  Kellys was sure quick to take my $100 out of my account the day I booked. But NOT customer service oriented to cancel before I had to call them! 
Never again and I tell everyone not to use Kellys in Belleville IL! 
They could have offered to maybe provide a few hours of free drive time for the local wedding etc. Something to make up for the inconvenience.  But I guess they have so much business they did not care!",2014-02-06 23:57:15

A few things about Alton:

East Alton is a rusty old industry town, a place in its hay day made some awesome stuff. They still have Winchester making ammunition their and Olin Brass cranking out precision copper and brass alloys. unfortunately, my reason to go  there was to decommission some research equipment at the olin Brass Metals research Lab.

I decided last minute to get a silkwrap instead of just a manicure. I'm not really a nail person, I get my nails done maybe once a month. I tried to explain to her how I wanted them done, which was kind of hard because of the language barrier. I don't like the fake plastic tip because they damage your real nail. I watched several Youtube videos on how a silkwrap was a better alternative. Anyway because I wanted a little length to my nails she was going to use the plastic tips. I told her no, and I explained to her why. She said so you want to use your own nail, I said yes. Long story short and $35 later I have a regular manicure. When I saw how short she was filing the nail (which was my own nails length), I asked her what she was doing. She stated this is how its done and there was nothing else she could do since I didn't want the tips. So even though I was unsatisfied with her service I tip her anyway. I guess she was unhappy with the tip and after she finished painting my nails, she had me dry them using the mini fan at her station. Normally they take you to the drying station. And I was supposed to receive another service, but she started work on someone else. By this time I'm livid; I grab my things and left. I was able to find another place to get my eye brows done (Brown Spa; which they did an excellent job and was very polite). I asked the tech about silkwraps and she confirmed what I though. She also told me she never goes to Tip Top Nails ""they're terrible"".
I was able to find the Youtube video, so I went back to Tip Top Nails and show it to her. She said they don't do it like that, and that if I showed her the video before she would have told me no. They refused to do my nails the way I wanted them, and refused to give me a refund.
I'm a stay at home mom so I don't get many days to myself, and it pisses me off that this chick messed up my day.
Save yourself some money and go to a different salon. The Tip Top Nail Salon in the Galleria Mall (Brentwood, MO) is so much better.",2012-11-09 03:34:57

Lucky for us, I followed my gut instinct and called Mr. Appliance a few days later and got the work done in a few days. In todays technological advanced world, what takes two weeks?  I understand if the refrigerator was ten years old or more, but this unit is only two years old and it is an LG.

I am very excited to find a great salon that is near my house & doesn't cost a million dollars to get something done. 

I have been here for the Benefit Brow Bar as well which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND, if you want your brows to look amazing - it is the best place you can go . I trust them with my life. 

I really can't say anything negative about Ulta. I am surprised at the ""rude customer service"" complaint because I have only experienced the best here. (plus there is always a coupon so I really REALLY love this place).

This place overbooks to get as many patients in as possible. I did not get quality care and was often forgotten about while there for my four visits. In contrast I have had two very positive experiences with Performance Physical Therapy over the years. I can't say much about the other ATI therapists or ATI branches, but I know where I'm going from now on. 

Detail: 
Picked this place because of the convenient location. What a mistake that was. I went here for four visits before I decided it was not worth my time or money.  Red flags from the first visit. I worked with Jeff and Nicki. Both nice people, but unfortunately unable to give me enough time for care. They were usually juggling 3-4 patients at the same time slot, meaning I spent a lot of time waiting around for the next instructions. A couple other times, Jeff had phone calls double booked with my time, so I didn't even get to see him or get to ask questions. Yet they always made sure I got the laser treatment, which I suspect may have been another way to bill more $ from my insurance. On the other hand I'm now at Performance for the same issue. From day 1 I got 1 on 1 uninterrupted care from someone who took more time to evaluate and answer questions. I went to performance 2 yrs ago for a back issue and had the exact same kind of good experience. Definitely worth the longer drive.",2014-11-14 02:40:48

I on the other hand have had much help and felt welcome.  I have been going to this library every day for the past year.  Why?

I am a school bus driver, from the Randolph County area.  I drive 20 minutes from my house to the bus yard, then pick up a student (Special Ed), and drive this student to a special school in the Belleville area.

Because of the low pay and long distance drive, I made arrangements with my boss, who is also the owner of the bus company, that I can stay up there, that the Library is only 2 miles from the school, and I would have plenty to keep me occupied.

Since it would also save him fuel/maintenance costs (making 1 trip as opposed to 2 trips), he allowed me to do that.  They have been good to me.  Yes sometimes it gets a little loud, and it has become a 2nd home for the less fortunate, but it has many great reference materials.

It is an old building, but I view the architecture as a work of art.  The second floor has a huge ceiling, with giant windows.  It is nice and open.  Thier reference section has shrunk down as they are re-arranging thier book set-up.

They have undergone renovations, and changed thier computer policy.  Now visitors can get 3, 30 minute sessions online.  The computer system is now linked up to all of southern IL, from Cairo to Effingham. 

If you have a library card anywhere in the southern part of the state, even if you have a Carbondale, or Mt Vernon card, it is now good for checking any book out there.  You can also access the Online Catalog system, and access your library account, and even place items on order yourself, and the staff will even show you how to do that if you ask them.

I am writing this review upon my final visits, due to, as I will be driving to a different school starting next week, in a different area of the Metro East.  They all knew what I did as a bus driver and was supportive of my being there as well.

So I have had good experiences overall, and rate the place about a 4, because it is in a building of Historical Significance, the computer access policy, an awesome microfilm (of Belleville News Democrat - Back to 1930s) collection, and a great children's section as well.",2013-10-24 14:57:11

The other day on my way to work without a lunch the morning DJ's were talking about the McRib and the limited availability. In all the years McRib has been offered, I have never tried it. With it's departure from the menu coming up soon and the positive spin one of the DJ's gave, I thought I'd try one for lunch. 

I ordered a McRib combo meal with a small french fry and small coke. Kevin the DJ, said he orders his without pickle and onions. I like pickles and onions, so I kept them on mine. I'm glad that I did, the bun along with the crisp pickles and onions were the best thing about the sandwich. The processed meat was tasteless, it was over sauced with a BBQ that was way to sweet. I thank my luck stars that I had an order of fries. I only wished I had upgraded to a larger size to fill the void left by a flavorless sandwich. 

This is a very clean and friendly McDonald's. I will not lower their star rating due to a seasonal sandwich that I did not enjoy. However, I would not recommend a McRib to anyone, not even my worst enemy.",2013-12-08 19:39:36

I am also a fair person and I don't want to write an initial review that might hurt a nice young couple that is, quite frankly, up against ""big business"". With their current training, their actual performance, I am satisfied. Bobby and Renee are an interesting and dynamic young couple. They are the ""american  dream"".  The pricing was great, the actual ""work day"" was well executed and they did a fine job. The complaint and gap is in their follow-through. 

They started the job (trees and fence removal with post/concrete removal; as quoted) on or about 10 SEP.  They came and picked up the final debris (after MY removal of the fence-posts) on 28 SEP.   So, maybe it is a case of getting what you paid for but that does not benefit me or Monkey.

With the right training, right support and discipline in scheduling, we would use them again. The job is done, our house is safe and the property looks better and is better. We are happy... finally.

 Here is where I would like to depart from the actual review of Monkey's Tree Service and instead wax poetic about American Small Business and the ""dream deferred"".  

When we lived in Baltimore we got two different ""home improvement"" jobs done. Both of those events were single day, a stretch of a few hours actually, done well, done crisply and with no discussion.  Both of those jobs were done by larger companies that had hired (illegal or not, I don't know, didn't check) Spanish speaking labor.

One of the refrains we heard from our friends at Monkey was ""our workers....fill in the blank"".  They had challenges maintaining a work force to complete the jobs that  Bobby hustled to get for the company. 

 They are trying to grow, trying to be successful but are held back by a few things; a lack of strategic planning, a lack of basic HR skills, a lack of clear roles for the two leads of the company.  If I had the time and money I would like to give them an injection of capitol and some executive coaching which would allow them to turn that business around and really succeed. 

What, you say there is a Small Business Administration to do that sort of thing...not for 2 people companies with one truck!  If you care about these kind of things more than NFL protests...pay attention to what your prospective leaders are promising in terms of the ""american dream"" and making ""america great""...and vote accordingly.",2017-09-29 03:16:15

My Father and myself are on a 18-wheeler almost 24/7/365, minus when we are at either our home or a friend/family's home.  I would say it's months between when we have what most would see as a 'home cooked meal', due to how expensive truck stop restaurants are, and a lot of actual restaurants don't allow, or have room, for semi (18-wheeler) parking, so obviously, we are fairly often shoppers at Walmart and Sam's Club.

As I said, it's rare we eat in a sit down restaurant, so today, my Father decided, he wanted Denny's, and wanted it to go.  I even called this particular Denny's before we pulled into the parking lot, to see if it was possible to use our own to go dishes we had gotten extra from another Denny's.  At first the lady I spoke to said yes, so I came inside to make the order.

Once at the counter, after waiting roughly 10 minutes to even see a employee in there, someone finally asked what I needed.  I told her, and she seemed hesitant about putting the food in the containers, but agreed.  About a hour later, another woman came out and said her boss said the containers were 'dirty' and could not be used due to 'cross contamination'.

I would've understood if they had said that because they were outside containers, technically, they couldn't use them, but saying the containers were dirty was uncalled for.  The way the inside of Denny's was, now that was dirty.  I'm overlooking the snow, but their attitudes need a very good cleaning.

So for anyone thinking of coming here?  Avoid this place like the plague.  Only thing going good for them is their wifi, and Flying J has plenty of that to use.",2016-01-20 19:24:25

I was dining alone so I sat at the counter. My order was taken quickly. . I ordered eggs Benedict, it doesn't come with any sides so I had to order hash browns on the side. I also ordered 2 pancakes since the pancake menu was so large, I assumed it was a point of pride for the restaurant. 

The eggs Benedict was good for a dinner, the english muffins were not toasted at all, but the eggs and the hollandaise sauce were good so I still count it as good. The hasbrowns had zero flavor at all. The portion was plentiful but they had no taste, even salt didn't help. The pancakes were good but this is where I have to really mark them down. FAKE Syrup, not real maple syrup. FAKE butter, they had some cheap off brand margarine. FAKE cream, some palm oil based off brand creamer. They also only had sweet and low and equal as sweeteners. 

In spite of sitting right in front of the coffee machine at the counter, I had to ask for a refill on my coffee. There is also no way the coffee they are brewing is Ronnoco. Ronnoco has a rich delicious flavor and a robust smell. This coffee had almost no flavor or scent, if they are brewing Ronnoco, then they are not making it with the proper amount.

I expect a mom and pop restaurant to serve real food. Real cream, real butter (hopefully whipped) and real maple syrup. The pancake prices aren't low enough to justify the ""cost cutting"" on the butter and syrup. Also it is still probably cheaper to buy the real stuff in bulk and package it in the store.

I gave it 3 stars instead of 2 because I think the basic food is decent. If I go back I will get an omelette and just drink water.",2015-04-15 22:10:22

He was told that he had to go the the hospital in an ambulance because he might be having a heart attack. He was told that blood pressure and chest x-rays were okay, but that he still needed to be taken by ambulance. My father absolutely did not want to take an ambulance, and explained that if they thought it was absolutely necessary his wife would drive him. He was then told that if he didn't follow orders, his insurance wouldn't have to cover his medical bills. He was frustrated, scared and embarrassed to be leaving in an ambulance for what he described as a minor lower arm/hand pain. Because of the diagnosis he received at this urgicare, the hospital put him through tests all day and made him spend the night. The next day he was finally seen by another physician in the hospital who quickly and easily diagnosed what the issue was. My father had a nerve in his elbow that was causing the pain. We're living in a time when health insurance prices are skyrocketing. This misdiagnosis is unacceptable and cost his insurance $16,000.

I've shopped here a couple times before and probably the single reason I haven't shopped here more are their prices. I think the trick is to shop their sales and avoid the place if you are going to pay full price. 

Leo helped me out and was very attentive and knowledgeable. He helped me try on a half dozen or so suits trying to find something I liked. After finding a couple suites I liked he also paired me up with a shirt and tie for the suit I didn't have anything else to go with it. 

Being a fairly skinny guy I took the liberty of having the suites altered a bit so they fit me better, as well as having the hems on the pants done. Here is my one beef with The Men's Warehouse. They sell unhemmed pants that cost from about $70 on up, then they charge you $12 to hem them. I have no problem paying to take in my suit jackets, but if I've paid $90 for a pair of unhemmed pants hitting me with a $12 alteration fee to hem them is a low blow in my opinion. The only good thing is that if they have made an alteration, they will make additional alterations on that seam free of charge. So if you get your pants taken in a bit then gain some weight, they will let them out so that you can still get into them. 

The buy one suit get one for $100 was really great as their suits were about $100 off regular price anyway, so it was almost a buy one get one free. I ended up paying about $420 for two extra long suits. The alterations cost me close to $100 which was a bit excessive in my opinion, but I don't have stuff altered all that often so perhaps that is about right. 

Being a tall, skinny guy I can always count on the Men's Warehouse to have something that will fit me, which is generally a challenge at other places. I'll continue to shop here when they have sales, otherwise I think I will shop elsewhere.",2011-05-27 15:24:02

I LOVE Pappy's, but I'm pretty close to love with 17th Street.  The ribs were indeed amazing.  The meat did not not fall off the bone, because that would be WRONG, people!  But they did bite cleanly and the crunchy edge was absolutely delicious, with a touch of sweetness.  I just wanted to suck on the bones after the meat was gone.  The brisket was moist and really good also. 

For the sides, I tried the baked beans which I enjoyed.  They were tangy-tomato-ey and I thought it was a nice touch that they used different types of beans together.  The mac and cheese was solid, if not outstanding.  The fries were seasoned and done well.  

This location is really big with several different rooms.  Our server did a good job of being attentive without being overbearing. When it came to dessert, they were out of several items since they make evertying in-house, so when it's gone, you're out of luck.  I tried the bread pudding which was sooooooo dense, it felt like it was just sitting on top of all the deliciousness in my belly.  And I was really disappointed that they used Cool Whip instead of real whipped cream.  Yuck.

All in all, 17th Street is definitely worth the drive, which isn't really that far, and I can't wait to get back and try more of the menu.",2010-11-23 02:40:21

Our friend who wanted to go to Coyote's couldn't remember the name, because the place is masquerading as Ranch and Grill, with Saloon and Bar thrown in. We need something we can type into Google Maps here.

Everything was littered with spelling errors. From the very sign on the building (""Coyotes"" with no apostrophe) to the chalkboard with drink specials (""Captin Morgan"") to literally every page of the menu (""Bluberry"" muffins, ""Ceaser"" salad, ""Rueben"" sandwich), my group spent most of our conversation mocking the appalling lack of proofreading. Those little red squiggly lines in MS Publisher aren't just for decoration, guys.

On the note of decoration, the design looks like it was fished out of the bargain bin at Hobby Lobby. There were two pairs of leather chaps on the wall, and ugly metal sconces that weren't even lit. We had time to spend staring at the décor, because it took an hour to get our main courses.

I'd eaten dinner at home, but I didn't want to sit there just drinking water. I ordered a mudslide and nachos. Both of them were absolutely atrocious. 

The $6 alleged mudslide was a mixture of generic, soft-serve chocolate ice cream (right out of a bad Chinese buffet) and off-brand syrup (I could tell it wasn't Hershey's or anything higher quality because of the distinct flavor of plastic). I had two of my friends taste it, and none of us could detect even the faintest hint of Kahlua or Bailey's, which are the most basic ingredients required for the drink.

The $7 ""Tri-color Nacho Chips with Spicy Queso Dip"" involved about thirty sparse chips (I counted) arranged on a melamine plate that'd been under a heat lamp. What self-respecting Tex-Mex restaurant charges this much (or anything) for a bunch of bland tortilla chips from a bag? It'd be gracious to say that the taste was on par with the sort of nacho cheese I got from my high school cafeteria, because I remember actually enjoying that stuff at the time. 

The cheese glop was very obviously served from a Costco-style container, and had no amount of spice to it. The chef apologized to us later, explaining that he was training new hires and they'd made it wrong, and produced a second plate of nachos as we were trying to leave. They were every bit as bad, except now they had a few pieces of jalapeño and bell pepper diced in there. He also had the gall to insist that they'd made it all from scratch--in which case, I'd love to know where they're getting the red and blue cornmeal, and exactly how they're preparing chemically flavored cheese product right in the kitchen. It was so gross, I was nauseous for hours afterward.

My friends weren't faring any better; annoyed, I asked to try their food. It was all terrible. One girl paid $7 for a 7"" DIY personal pizza that she could've gotten for a dollar from a gas station, topped with pineapple chunks that were clearly from a can. Another friend paid $8 for a 12"" pizza, which makes zero sense. The pricing structure is completely off. Another girl had a pulled pork sandwich that she took two bites of and refused a to-go container for, probably because it was a scoop of lukewarm pork on burnt bread, served with freezerburnt fries that I'd bet were Ore-Ida or the equivalent. 

The only good thing was the beer my boyfriend ordered, because it's hard to screw that up. Our server was all right; she was doing her best with what the kitchen gave her to work with. She was friendly, but couldn't tell us what the drink special of the day was (consistently rotated Monday through Friday, per the website). A friend asked what the applesauce shots were made with. The server and the bartender didn't know--they apparently had to call the head bartender to find out how they'd been prepared. I wonder what they'd do if the shots were actually selling and they had to make more?

The manager came out to speak with us about our experience, and decided to lecture me about the definition of the word ""queso,"" and that since it just means ""cheese,"" it's somehow excusable to serve that slop and call it dip. I speak Spanish--I don't need this speech. She also insisted that it wasn't microwaved, they used heat lamps. Oh boy! If you made your chips yourself as you claim, they'd be hot from a deep fryer, and wouldn't need to warm them under a lamp for god knows how long.

My mudslide and nachos were both comped, but unfortunately most of our party paid for food they hardly touched. Extraordinarily bad customer service, and this was from the manager.

The website and menu include tons of photos stolen from Google Images. We spent a while looking for the sliders on the back page, which aren't even for sale. Hint: don't show pictures of happy customers that are not yours, in a restaurant that's not yours, with a chef preparing pasta dishes you don't serve.

If I wanted to spend $7 on industrial-bagged nachos with reheated cheese, I would've bought them at the movie theater.",2012-05-08 17:32:21

All previous reviewers' comments about Jim, the chocolate bar (note: the pictures on Yelp do not do it justice; we're talking a bureau top FULL of various chocolates), and the attention to detail are spot on.  Though we wanted to getaway from the cares of this world, having a TV in the room playing classical music was quite a nice, elegant addition that transported us back to the Victorian era.
If you're trying to decide which package to spring for, I'd suggest going for one that includes breakfast in bed.  Jean, who made our breakfast, had me get into bed before placing my breakfast tray over my lap.  The breakfast comes complete with an appetizer, entree, dessert, and palate cleansing liquor.

Also, it's a substantial expense!

That said, what should a person expect? If a repair job by a handyman is selected, then one gets what one pays for. If a person opts in favor of an established company selling quality products, the expectation it that a job should be done professionally and in a reasonable time-frame, and that the customer should feel good about both the hardware quality and workmanship. Describing the expectation is important because BELOMAN exceeded it in almost every regard.

1) They use Carrier systems, which was the brand of condenser I replaced. Not only are the new units much nicer (despite not being top-of-the-line or anything fancy), but the coil inside my house is MUCH nicer. The original home manufacturer used a generic coil on the inside, which is the only kind I'd ever seen, so the complete Carrier system was nicer than my expectations.

2) When they arrived to do the install, there were two complications: that the unit wouldn't fit on the house-bracket (so it needed the ground plate) and that the nice inside coil was a bit wider and needed custom transitions to fit properly. No problem for BELOMAN! They had the common base on-hand, and metal workers took measurements, coming back from their shop with perfectly sized adapters to complete the professional installation.

3) My home has two furnaces, so I was quoted two days to complete the installation (two A/Cs onto existing furnaces). Additionally, I was informed that the personnel could not complete the outdoor soldering and electrical work if there were thunderstorms. Knowing that storms were predicted for the second installation day, two extra people arrived in the morning to accelerate the installation! This all-hands-on-deck approach (including someone who I overheard mentioning that he could only help for an hour before he had to be at another appointment) was truly exceptional. I'm sure don't always have capacity to do that, but to know that they will when they can.

4) As my air conditioning was failing, I had researched many methods to try and keep my house cooler. This left me with several questions about how best to use the new system moving forward. They took ample time to answer them and look at various ducts about which I had questions. They did not, at any point, seem rushed or bothered by taking the time to help me. In addition, they provided thoughtful responses that made me appreciate their time and knowledge (and they still finished ahead of schedule)!

5) The person who came to the house also did a great job listening to my needs and designing a solution that would accommodate.

6) On top of all this, they were genuinely nice people. They were mindful of my dog when coming in and out of the house (petting him even), and even asked about the project I was working on in my garage. 

Together, all this made me feel that the whole team really was invested in me, my home, and of course my air conditioning. I don't know if there's anything else they could have done to make the experience more enjoyable. I would recommend them to anyone who wants a quality job, done right, the first time, by great professionals.",2016-09-09 17:06:57

From the moment we arrived, the ladies in the check in trailer were extremely helpful and added to the overall experience.  They took us back to give us the run down of rules, and explain how to drive the car.  What to do and how to do it.  Even if you have never been in a race car, they will give you more than enough information to make you comfortable getting in and running.

It was a very hot day, but we all got in our fire suits, picked out a helmet and got pictures taken by the car we were going to drive.  They stuffed ear pieces in the helmets and we were walked through every lap by a team member in the stands.  He helped with lap traffic and reminding you to be smooth and controlled when drifting through a corner.  I have done several racing schools, Michigan, Gateway, but never ran on dirt.  I have to tell you, it is a totally different experience.  

It was a great time, and all my technicians that won were extremely happy with the program.

Hokkaido opened recently in the old Ryan's Steakhouse location and they have done some extensive renovations to the interior. Overall the selection is great, traditional Asian inspired food, American, large desert bar, and a hibachi station. The food is great, probably one of the best Asian buffet in the St.Louis area. The food was fresh and the chicken was moist and tender, nothing was dried or tasted like it was sitting out for a long time. 

Prices are fair, lunch was about 25 for two with drinks. A little bit more expensive than some of the other choices like Ginger, however the food was much better and that more than makes up for the difference. Trust me if you are considering between the two I would choose Hokkaido any day over Ginger, and I used to love Ginger. 

For those in Missouri Hokkaido also has a location in North County, more specifically Florissant, MO off North Highway 67. I haven't been to this location yet however I would assume that the quality is the same..",2013-01-28 15:24:11

I've been coming here for the past 2 years for my monthly haircut (my hair grows fast). I don't have a favorite stylist I just go with who is available, and I have never had a bad experience. The stylist are nice, quick, and professional.

I really like how they save your preferences in their computer. It eliminates explaining what you want, there doesn't seem to be any confusion, and they confirm what you want before they begin.

I don't need a flashy salon, just a place that gets the job done. This place can do that, and they won't hurt your wallet either.",2010-12-13 23:25:36

I enjoy coming here for lunch or dinner because of the delicious food.  I do not, however, enjoy the service which saddens me terribly because like I said, I love their food and their pecan pies during the fall.

Every experience I have had here has been disappointing when it comes to the service.  I have been to the one in Caseyville, and Troy but I have been to this location the most.  Regardless of the location, I get the same low quality type of service.  The waitresses always seem very lethargic, stressed out, rushed, and not very friendly.  I have been there during different hours of the day, including times when they aren't busy and yet I have never had a server who actually looked like they even remotely have any interest in serving their clients.  Unfortunately, these horrible experiences have been embedded inside my head that sometimes, even when I feel like going there for their food, the memories of bad service holds me back and instead takes me somewhere else.  

To the food, I love the cracker barrel sampler but I have also had their country fried steak and they were all good.  For the price, you're really getting a great bargain and they give you three sides of a long list of sides which is really awesome because you can try out different things.  

I also have to mention that this place does have a great feel to it for dinning and the food that they serve compliments the atmosphere.  I definitely commend them for doing a great job on that part.  However, in an overall rating, I would give the service a 1-star and the food a 3-star.",2013-01-28 00:21:59

Before going to this Dobb's location to get a quote, I had already received a quote from another mechanic. So to be clear, I already knew what was wrong with my vehicle and I explained to Ron that I simply just needed a quote for the issues that had already been diagnosed from the previous mechanic. No big deal, right? Apparently not! Upon retrieving my vehicle from Dobb's, Ron informs me that I am being charged $129 for an estimate. At no point did Ron explain or tell me that I would be charged $129 for a simple quote. Again, I already knew what was wrong with my vehicle, I was simply price shopping. After over an hour of arguing (which Ron was extremely rude, unprofessional and spoke to me as if I was a neighbor he didn't care or have any respect for) Ron finally agreed to lower to charge to $100. At this point he also told me that him as well as the other mechanics would have to cover the $29 ""discount"" I received. Now c'mon.. Really, Ron? You guys had to cover ""my bill""? Another drop of untruth in a waterfall of lies, Ronnie. I paid the $100 and left with my faith in humanity once again shaken. This is simply a warning to my fellow road warriors. BUYER BEWARE!

 A month before our lease was up, we received a $100 late fee charge.  When I went to the office to see what it was for, as we were NEVER late on our rent.

When I asked her why it took so long (it was now October), she didn't have an answer for me. So we sucked it up and paid the stupid late fee knowing it wasn't late.  THEN a few weeks after moving out, we received a charge of $125 listed as ""pet cleaning"".  I personally steam cleaned the floors AND knew that there was still a pet deposit of $150 (the other $150 was supposedly nonrefundable).  My boyfriend called several times to discuss the matter, and was always given the run around and promised a return call.  THEN yesterday we received a letter indicating they had turned us over to collections.

We decided to go bowling because it's something we both enjoy and don't do very often. Since we were in Fairview, we came here. I had been here a couple of times since I was on the bowling team in high school. The alley is average and a little outdated, but the lanes, balls, and seating areas were fine for us. 

We went to the counter and we were not treated kindly. We ask said we wanted to get a lane and the lady only said ""bowl fast, were cleaning the lanes in 20 minutes."" Like I said spending time in alleys before, I understood this. So, we said we would just want one game. I guess there must have been some miscommunication, but she was extremely rude and began yelling at us. After confusion was taken care of and she understood it was one game for each of us and on the same lane, she said I will put you away from the oiler to you have more time. Then, she put us only a few lanes away from where the oiler began so I don't understand what she was thinking? We were rushed in our one game. This would not have seemed so bad if it weren't for the terrible service we received at the counter. 

Since we felt our time together had been cut short, we decided to be goofy and go to the arcade. I got cash out from the atm and got $10 worth of coins. I immediately regretted my decision. 80% of the machines took my tokens without working and the change back didn't work. Then, most did not even give out tickets. When we tried to tell someone, no one was at the counter. 

Overall, what we thought would be a relaxing afternoon turned out to be a terrible lesson.@",2015-12-10 02:52:42

Maybe the very strange promotional art? I thought it was going to be very hippie, and it was in a way, but it brought out a lot of people...and not all of them were hippies. I do love the idea though: arts and crafts through upcycled material...how much cooler is that?

Getting there is somewhat of a pain because Highway 50 narrows down to one lane each way when you get close to the park. Add to that Oktoberfests galore, and you have a very nice recipe for ""traffic jam"". Everyone parks everywhere, but surprisingly enough, parking wasn't that big of a deal. It is really a family thing too. They have arts and crafts for the kids, indie bands playing, lots of picnic tables set up with the usual assortment of fair foods, an alpaca petting zoo, and of course, Girl Scouts selling cookies. 

But the booths themselves are the showcase, and the media is quite varied, even though I heard a booth owner complain, ""It is so hard nowadays to be original."" She was selling wire jewelry, so I guess I can see her point. And really, my favorite booths are really the unique ones like Beqi Clothing and Newberry Furniture. The Newberrys repurpose old wood for new stuff...their current thing consists of Adirondack chairs made from an old barn. And Beqi takes vintage clothing and changes it all around..she has quite the gift. The whole thing is pretty big, and it really does impress me that there are so many craftsters in the area.",2011-09-27 06:30:27

This had the best reviews in the St. Louis area, so I was a little put off by the exterior: right next to a car dealership, one car in the parking lot, adjoined to a jewelry store, and one dim window.

The inside is nothing special either. Dimly lit, minimal decor, obviously converted from some kind of diner.

Service was great until we were ready to pay and then it took about 20 minutes.

Miso soup had good flavor, but was pretty bare bones with very little tofu or seaweed in it. Ginger dressing salad was very tasty, but didn't have much of a ginger flavor.

We ordered the Dragon Roll, Volcano, and another one I can't think of. Presentation was pretty. The rolls are good sized, but most of it is due to a thick layer of rice. The inside of the rolls was bland and didn't appear to have half the ingredients listed on the menu.

As an avid sushi eater originally from Chicago, I'd say this place is nothing special. The ambiance and sushi are average, at best. What little fish I could taste didn't taste very fresh. But the free pineapple dessert was a welcomed surprise. I'd say despite reviews, there's is probably a better place closer to St. Louis.",2014-05-25 20:37:08

However I remembered there's a pick n pull in Washington Park, IL not too far from me. It's located right off I 64, pass the 2 strip clubs. 

Now my normal DIY has nothing to do with cars. But I'm confident I can do this.... It's only a battery right!?! Right!? 

Going in there is a $2 entrance fee however you don't have to pull the battery from the cars so you don't have to pay the fee. The battery's are not located in the lot but in the main area. There's also a book with cars makes and models so to you get the correct battery. The cashier was helpful in letting me know that. I found the battery in the book But not on the table. There was another cashier who came over to help me. Said they had it in the back, he got it for me and rung me out. Battery was $52.99 and if I brought my original battery back for them to dispose of I would get $11 back. 

So I'm 5'4, cute lil thang with my sunglasses and handy dandy toolbox walking out to my car with this battery. I could only imagine the thoughts of all these men. I was successful with changing out my battery and got my $11 back. All without breaking my nails but I did get a little dirty.

I had practiced yoga for 7 years but stopped for some time due to injury. I recently decided to start practicing again, and wanted to find both a great studio and great instructors. 

With Vive Yoga, I found both.

I contacted Vive via email to discuss private sessions to start, just so I could get back into the swing of things before taking a class. I wanted to make sure that I wasn't a disruption and that I could do all the poses. Alexis (co-owner) was very prompt in responding, discussing, and understanding my concerns. With that out of the way, she set up an appointment time for a private session.

When my appointment time came, Alexis was there and ready to go. Behind the desk they have bottled water for sale, a room to store your phone/shoes/keys, and the bathrooms. The studio is in the basement of a professional building and is laid out like a normal studio with plenty of room to practice. It's very clean and is enjoyable to practice in. They offer both yoga blocks and straps should you need them, and they have mats available too. Alexis quickly discussed the points I had mentioned in email and we were off. (It was nice that I didn't have to remind her, just confirm)

After years off from yoga, Alexis kept me working, and was doing a great job reminding me when to breath, gave me enough time to catch up when I was struggling, and offering modifiers. At the end of the session she sat and spoke with me about taking a few more private sessions and was empathetic and encouraging about my return. I signed up for a few more private sessions and she was truly wonderful about helping me return to Yoga.  After a few more private sessions, (I still have one left), we discussed that I was ready for a group class.

I attended the Monday night Vinyasa Flow class with Felice (co-owner). I hadn't done Vinyasa before, I had always practicing Hatha. Felice was a wonderful instructor and was very good about walking around to make sure everyone was doing the poses correctly. It was so nice to have an instructor provide a great work out and yet make the class light and fun, she has a great sense of humor. One thing I want to point out, Felice starts the class by asking if anyone is opposed to an assisted adjustment, and if you are, you simply raise your hand. Alexis doesn't do hands on, but will demo next to you. This is a truly great thing, and I wish more Yoga studios asked first. Keep that up! 

On Tuesday morning Alexis reached out to me to see how my first group class in years went, and to make sure I didn't have any questions/concerns, that's fantastic customer service!

I attended my second group class tonight with Alexis, Hatha this time and it was great. I will be returning for both Vinyasa Flow and Hatha classes (Nice that they switch up the day and evening classes so no matter your schedule, you get a choice). When I am back in shape, will be going to the Power Yoga class. There is also a Beginner class, but I haven't attended that one, and there is a children's class too. Oh, and they have lunch time Yoga once a week!

A couple other things to point out quickly; They have a really good Facebook/Website presence, so if you have questions or want to know what else is going on with the studio, it's a click away. They do also have a small section of tanks/yoga pants that they designed for sale and I have never heard them being pushy sales women like I have seen with some other studios. (They don't have shirts for men, but with our small demographic in Yoga, I'm NOT going to knock them for that, but I was told tonight they are looking into making a small batch for the guys). The prices of their classes are extremely competitive, so even people on a budget won't really have an excuse to skip class. To be fair, I do have to point out they are a new studio, so they may have a few quirts to work out in the system as time goes on, but I haven't seen any yet. 

My last point is my most important point. They are good ethical teachers! 

I have seen my fair share of yoga teachers that know the poses, and can lead a class, but they only really talk the talk. These women walk the walk. From their Facebook page alone you can see they are really interested in getting children involved in Yoga and helping people learn more about nutrition and health in general. They even lead classes' offsite that seem fun (I haven't attended one yet, but I've seen the photos). They are both very kind and encouraging with issues you may have. They are both Yogi's in mind, body, and soul. 

I can't recommend them enough, I did serious research regarding studios and instructors in the area and I am happy to say they not only met my high expectations, but bested them. They opened a few months ago, but they have really done a great job, looking forward to more time in the studio

Nice job Alexis and Felice, keep up the great work!",2017-09-15 01:37:50

The thing that makes this place stand out is their 40"" pizza.  It is the size of a table.  They have to cut a slit in their doors leading to the back room to bring the thing out!  They have a pizza challenge which has only been accomplished twice.  Their 36"" pizza to be eaten by 3 people in 1/2 hour.

Kudos to Mark Springer, Manager for hiring Julian Henson, a top notch Closer, that's right, Closer! 

Unlike other salesmen at the countless dealerships whom we met over the past two years, Julian hopped in the back seat like one of the family.  During our test drive, Julian and Kent talked about the various trucks they both have had throughout their driving years, while at the same time, never missing a beat answering all of my important questions, such as ""what's this knob do"", ""where's the USB port"", ""where do I control the temperature on my side"", and many more. It was as though we were at a family reunion, and these two cousins who hadn't seen each other for years, were catching up on old times! I'm so grateful for Julian. 

Julian is a down to earth young man who honestly cared that what we were looking at, is what we really wanted. Julian went the extra mile to ensure we drove away without any regrets. 

Julian, being new to Waterloo, helped pass the time while we waited for Bill, by asking about the different golf courses, fishing holes, and local events. Together, we googled Ann Briar, Mystic Oaks, Acorns, Trapper Falls, as well as the local nightlife uptown. Yes Waterloo has come a long way since I moved here in 1969, and Julian Henson is a wonderful, welcome addition to our town. 

Bill Rolfus reviewed with Kent all options available (which ones would be good for us and which ones not so good); and within minutes...Kent was the proud owner of a 2013 Ford truck...FINALLY!!!

If you are looking for someone to help you find the truck or car of your dreams, go see Julian Henson at Sunset Ford of Waterloo, and tell him Pam and Kent said ""Hi""!",2019-03-26 01:17:53

I said ok and she went to get it, returning with out saying they were out.  How do you run out on a Saturday afternoon when your promoting that beer.  We should have just left, but we didn't.
We completed the order and don't get me wrong, the server was nice but never saw a hint of a manager and other than the server, no one acknowledged us as there.

You make it sound like you gave me a choice to come back or not.  You most defiantly did NOT give me an option to return.  When I asked that my repair order be documented, Mike Hasamer threw my keys down on the table and explained to me that he was ""not going to sit there and write a book with me"".  He also explained that he was not being paid to put in my comments.  Sounds to me like when a customer requests documentation it makes Cassens uncomfortable.  I think what people would be interested to know is why me not purchasing a vechicle from you and me being the third owner has anything to do with me bringing a vechicle to you under warranty.  You were unable to accurately diagnose a problem!  There was a defect and I will elaborate on that at a later time.

I drive a company leased car, and most shops see this as a blank check to do whatever they want without my approval, so I'm always on guard. Today the price and service was good, but what irked me enough to write about was when I signed the papers to leave. Papers signed and they hand me a fleet driver info booklet I keep in my glove box. I was obviously perplexed, so Greg quickly interjected he needed some additional info from it. 
I was sitting in the waiting room, and they never asked me any questions or where to find this book they ""needed"". BTW, all the pertinent fleet info was on the card I gave Greg when I checked in. The booklet has nothing more they need, it's info for the driver. 

I'm pissed that they snooped my car while I waited patiently.

1)  The sign out front didn't even say Baymont, but WOWHOTEL
2)  The room smelled terrible.  When telling the front desk we were told that ""all the rooms have a smell to them now""
3)  The elevator was broken
4)  No drain stoppers in either the bath tub or the sink, when asking the front desk for them, was told, ""we don't have any""
5)  Large amount of dust/drywall dust covering the lower portion of the door in the bathroom
6)  Room was not cleaned while we were here even though we left the room Saturday morning at 9:15 AM and didn't return until 6pm
7)  Waffle mix was not properly prepared and would not make a waffle
8)  Doors to the rooms do not slow down before closing, so they slam shut usless someone closes them manually
9)  No hangers in the closet, front desk unable to provide any
10)  When using the room phone to dial the front desk, it continues to ring even after connecting with the front desk
11)  Wi-Fi stopped working after the first night and front desk said that there was nothing they could do and the reason they gave was because ""a lot of people must be using it""
12)  Two dead cockroaches in bathroom
13)  Unable to turn the heater in the room on because it set the fire alarm off snd produced a burning smell.  When alerting the front desk, was told, ""We will add it to the list.""

This was, from start to finish, one of the worst hotel properties I have stayed at.  Nothing worked, the rooms smelled, and it should not have been operational if the construction being done was this much of a detriment to the operation of the hotel.",2017-10-29 22:26:23

Now that I am older and wiser, I have come to realize, Rally's is a little bit gross, just like all fast food really, two drive-thru windows isn't really novel, and the burgers aren't that good, juicy or loaded, they are just really REALLY big.  

Rally's has some of the most annoying jingle music of any commercial on local television as well.  I often get that ""You gotta eat"" song stuck in my head.  It's very annoying.  Rally's has a fairly limited menu (standard burger, fries, and chicken sandwich of most fast food restaurants) and really, it's not as cheap as the advertisements seem to lead you to believe.

When my parents visit me in LA, they ask the owners to make a special batch of their extraordinary Lo Mein Noodles to bring out to me.

-Lunch Buffet (I think it's about $6 now?) It's small, but it features all of their best recipes, and there's always plenty to fill you up. If you come in for the buffet and the food looks like it's been sitting there for too long, they will make a fresh batch just for you. It's not like a normal Chinese Buffet where there are 8 buffet tables, with everything you can think of including sushi and pizza.

2. Jan. 5 No one came, no one called
3. 1 week later I called the service number.  No one knew anything.  Said they'd check into it.  Never heard back from them.
4.  Called again on March 2.  No one could read the original tech's writing.  Said they didn't know what the problem was, but would set up an appointment
5. March 3. I got a call from Illinois American who said the problem with the meter was our fault and we would have to arrange for a plumber to fix it.  I called the Alton service number again and they still didn't know what the problem was.
6. March 4  Received a letter dated March 1 that the meter needed to be changed and to call for an appointment.  Waited a week to call so that I could calm down from their gross incompetency.
7.  Called  and made an appointment.  Tech came out about March 23.  Spent a few  minutes with the meter.  Went out to his truck to get a larger wrench and came back in and changed the water meter. Said "" Right tool for the right job.  Some of these young, inexperienced guys are afraid they'll break something.""  Took less than 10 minutes and was apologetic for the water company.
8,  April 8  Got another letter from  Illinois American saying the meter needed to be changed or water would be turned off in 10 days.  Too stupid to know they've already changed it.  My husband will call on Monday.  If they turn off our water we will sue them and I will report them to the Illinois Department on Aging.

All of the kids seemed happy too.  This visit was a surprise visit so I know it wasn't staged.  To top it all off, they were the cheapest day care we had visited.

FSLC offers more services than most other day cares.  They offer 24 hour care for those parents that work shifts.  They also offer a ""Parent's Night Out"" one Saturday each month.  This consist of child care from 6 pm to midnight to allow parents to go out and have fun by themselves.

I am not sure what that meant because we did not receive any kind of discount. They had a lunch buffet with a salad buffet. They only offer Pepsi products. They have beer on tap but no wine. The salad bar had four different types of salad dressing. It was clean and had many options to chose from: black olives, eggs, sunflower seeds, two kinds of cheeses, and peppers. They had deep dish and thin crust options on the lunch buffet. The server kept coming around and cleaning the tables off, for some reason this made me think that they did not have enough plates for everyone.

I was never satisfied with their service but my spouse didn't want to change until it finally became intolerable. First, they call all the time to sell new services. Second, their employees claim to have extensive lawn care experience and knowledge, but in many conversations with them over the years they continually show this is not the case. Example (two of many), they tried to sell me grub control for $600 after I had completed grub control myself and knew there had been no grubs for at least a year. They tried to tell me grubs were the reason my lawn was turning brown! It was late summer, over 100 degrees for several days and I don't water. My lawn was going dormant, not being eaten by grubs! Next example, they tried to sell me lime service for several hundred dollars to adjust the pH of my lawn. I asked if they had done a soil test and the person at my front door didn't know what that was or why he would want to apply lime or why a soil test is important.  The office then called me in response to this conversation and told me a soil test isn't required in this state but their tech ""could tell"" my lawn needed lime. He didn't know what pH is or what the relationship to lime is, so how could he know if my lawn needed lime? It's important to note I had already done a soil test through my local extension and my pH was fine. Third, they spray indiscriminately on windy days. On several occasions I witnessed TeeTime spraying in 30 mph winds to include spraying of herbicide on my trees. One year I lost 5 healthy trees during perfect growing weather within days after witnessing one of these indiscriminate spray incidents.  All the weeds inside the drip line of these trees were dead within a day or two of this incident and the trees quickly followed. TeeTime essentially blew me off and said there was no way their people would spray on my trees and they wouldn't spray in 30 mph winds. I wish I had taken a photo. Fourth, they are not supposed to apply fertilizer, weed killer, etc within a certain distance of gardens growing edible plants. We discussed this before we contracted with them. Yet I repeatedly caught them applying these chemicals right up to the edge of my 30x30 foot vegetable garden with fruits and vegetables clearly visible! And I could go on and on. Over a period of 9 years I have found Tee Time to be overly focused on sales, not knowledgeable about lawn care, and downright negligent in their application practices, which is a byproduct of poor training.

Where I'm from Cooter means something decidedly different. So I was curious, and I got the snoot and chicken wings combo. The wings were fine (suuuuuper deep fried). Needless to say, the snoot qualifies as one of the grossest things I have ever tried to consume. And I eat plenty of crazy food. For the randos like me trying something new, snoot is basically a sheet of deep fried pig fat. Imagine taking a layer of pork rinds, pressing them together and frying a second time just to be sure they are extra crispy. I got the buffalo wing sauce which was slathered on the wings and the snoot. But this didn't hide a somewhat rancid smell that emanated from the snoot. No wonder obesity is high in southern Illinois...

Service was cordial - took about 10 minutes to get the food. Seating is limited and not that comfortable (stools and a few tables). Only drinks I saw were fountain soda (no sweet or unsweet tea, no lemonade). Everything is a la carte (all sides must be purchased separate except for slices of white bread), which I didn't really like. Got the mashed sweet potato - didn't realize this is basically a dessert - loaded with sugar and cinnamon. Do not recommend unless you want to eat pie filling with your snoot.....

For some reason, like most dry cleaners, they seem to relish posting a half-dozen signs telling the customers all the bad things that will befall them if they don't do exactly as expected by the business. Signs kind of set a negative tone. We're not the enemy, we are the customers!

I'm probably being generous with the 3 stars; but the service was not as bad as mentioned by others and the clothes appear to be clean.

A group of us usually head out on a Friday for ""Party at the Park."" $13 gets you in for the night and this includes an all you can eat buffet which is really just a fantastically fried food feast. The food is pretty artery clogging gross and every single minute I spend enjoy it I hate myself a little more BUT what doesn't taste good fried? Really? So i fill my plate with all kinds of fried goodness and try not to look down at my plate to survey the damage as I indulge. They also have $1 bud products (bottles) and pretty cheap mixed drinks all night. 

I am not a big gambler and my strategy is to pick a horse with a name I like and put down the minimum bet which is $2. Sometimes (not often) this works for me and it is pretty exciting when you see your horse cross the finish line first. It does get super crowded so if you want any shot at sitting down you have to get there early. 

From the fried food to the fabulous people watching this is definitely an experience and I am sure we will continue our once a year tradition.",2011-06-29 13:56:38

When you get to the top level of the Lewis and Clark Confluence Tower and burst in to song singing, On A Clear Day You Can See Forever, I can tell you, you will not be the first. All those tower guides have heard it before, it's not that original. However, I do think my rendition was note worthy.

I've been twice, I had to do a re-visit because on the first it was an overcast day. 
It was amazing how far I could see when a few clouds were removed from blocking my view. Each time, our tour guide was knowledgeable about the history of the area and Lewis and Clark. Our first guide on the cloudy day was witty and put his own spin on the presentation of information. The second guide sounded like a rehearsed tour guide, but you still get the info you need.

I bought a used refrigerator from this company on 9/14/2017. After a few days the refrigerator started making a loud noise. The company sent out a repair man who said the condenser was bad and that he could tone down the noise but could not get rid of it completely. I told them that was unacceptable and we needed them to replace the refrigerator. They sent another one out. The freezer had no shelves even though there was a place for the shelves. There were 2 missing crisper drawer, & the metal bars on the door of the refrigerator were bent and about to break. The company told me that they would send out the shelves for the freezer and the two missing crisper drawers. This was approximately Oct. 6 2017, Said we would have them by the following Tuesday or Wednesday. Spoke with them on Columbus day and they promised again to have them there by Oct 10th or 11th. Again they did not show up. Although I cannot make complaints for other people, I have spoken to a couple of people who had the same experience. They give you the run around until you finally give up. I paid $125.00 for a refrigerator that work and had the necessary shelving. This company sold me a refrigerator that worked for 2 days. Every since then they have been giving me the run around. They have my money and I have a large box the cools but does not have the interior shelving.

This IHOP re-opened a few days ago after ""voluntarily"" closing down for two months to make health code related repairs.  Building is cold, not sure the heat is on.  Overheard staff say a pipe had froze over night and they had no water and that the owner was aware (for several hours).  However; no plumber was on site.  Eventually I heard a staff member say that they were going to close for the day due to no water.  

Not sure a manager was on duty.  I hardly ate my food but no one asked if anything was wrong with the food.  Did I mention the syrup on the table was frozen?  Frozen.  I went to pour the full bottle of strawberry syrup on my pancakes...and nothing came out.  The server noticed and then gave me some heated up syrup in a paper cup.  

I thought that since the heat was most likely off and no water that maybe my meal would be comp'd or offered a discount?  I wasn't really expecting a free meal (food was good...was too cold in the building), but the offer would have gone a long way. Staff is working the best they can with what they got.  With that said, I'm pretty sure doors shouldn't have opened  today with no water.

I had expected significant changes to the interior, but was surprised that very few changes were made.

This is the last visit I'll make to this IHOP until they tear it down and build a new one.

I was on my way to chipotle in search of a remotely healthy meal after my workout. As I pulled up at 8:55pm the ""open"" sign was off and they were turning the lights off. Sighing, I drove across the street to smoothie king where the open light was still shining. I thought, surely something remotely healthy can be found here.

I walked in to the death glare of two high school looking girls. One rolled her eyes and shouted to the back, ""hey we need a blender back"" while the other said ""I'm gonna turn the light off cause WE'RE CLOSED"". I should've turned around and left right then and there. Pardon me for providing you with my business a few minutes before closing.

So I hurried to pick something after being asked 3 times what I wanted within 90 seconds. I settled for a smoothie that had ""meal replacement"" next to it, thinking it would be the best option for a high protein, low calorie meal. After they begrudgingly made my smoothie and handed it over (additional glares free of charge) I took one sip. Wait no, I'm still sucking on the straw... 3 minutes later, still sucking. It is so thick I can't drink it.

I give it the drive home to thin out. Then I open the lid, it's literally smoothie smush on the rocks. So I decide to look up the nutritional info to see if the effort is worth the while. And let me tell you what I found: OVER 150 CARBS IN ONE FREAKING CUP OF OVERPRICED BLENDED FRUIT AND ICE. I threw it away and made some broccoli. I didn't realize that ""meal replacement"" meant it could replace the #4 meal at McDonalds. 

Needless to say, the overwhelmingly friendly customer service, high quality and reasonably priced HEALTH CONSCIOUS smoothie left me yearning for more.",2015-11-21 03:36:10

Two weeks ago, I was driving to work and was at like 65 mph when my car started making this scratching kind of sound at the front. No sputtering, blocking, rumbling noises...just a weird scratchy sound. I got to work, consulted Google, and called my friend who's a mechanic about all the dreaded possibilities it could be. He told me to stick with diagnosing people and he would take a look at it if I ever decided to come up to Chicago. (If you don't see the humor and irony in this, you don't know me very well.).

Fast forward. So I really wasn't as worried because the noise never happened again and my car needed some maintenance anyway so I was planning on bringing it in sometime this month. But today, I started my car down the street and looked in the rearview mirror to see this trail of fluid. Condensation? Fluid leak? I don't know. I'm not a car doctor. But coupled that to the weird scratching noise that may have indicated power steering or braking problems (thanks, Google!), I was worried enough to drive back home and call Sears. I mean, I drive fast, but I'm not THAT stupid; last thing I want is the steering out at 80 mph. 

The conversation went like this (and yes, I do sound stupid):
Me: Hey, so I might have a leak. I'm not sure. There's a trail of fluid down my street.
Mechanic: Ok. What color is it?
Me: Uh, I'm not sure. It just looks wet. But I popped my hood and this container that has pink stuff looks low?
Mechanic: Hm. Well, just bring it in. We'll look at it. 
Me: Like right now?
Mechanic: Yep. 

So I get there, and there's like four other cars in the bay, but they put my car in right away. They take a look and tell me everything is a-ok, but that it's time for my oil change and the power steering fluid is a little low. No leaking though. OH, and that pink stuff is supposed to be at that level because it's coolant and circulates. I mean, who would have thought?! ;) 

So thanks, guys, for not laughing at me. And thanks for getting me in right away. And thanks for being all right with me running out in the bay in flip flops asking  where the coolant level should be and what other weirdo containers I need to look at if I ever need to do something like this again (which I feel like is the equivalent of coming into the OR in flip flops). I'm sure I'll be back with more car symptoms in tow.",2012-12-05 00:54:37

Plus it comes with a salad. And the salad was served on a plate. I cannot say how grateful I was for getting a salad served on a plate, so I could toss it appropriately! Bleu cheese dressing was so lovely.

After having eaten all the salad, I couldn't eat too much pizza, but it was delicious.

The second choice is a surly female that has not made eye contact with anyone in the store for the hour I have been waiting.  She has been talking down to the customer the entire time.  Unfortunately the customer is too naive to recognize it.  

The third stooge is baby Huey and is so new that he offers assistance and if you need something more complicated than a replacement cable he can't help you.

Spike's has a very nice deck out front that would be enjoyable on a cool evening.  All the parking is out back and we had no trouble finding a space.  Our server was a very nice young lady.  She was wearing knee-high boots which had to be uncomfortable for her at some point.  There is free WiFi which worked well (open network).  We sat next to one of the HDTVs which had an excellent picture.  I ordered a Bud LIght (very cold) on tap and my wife ordered a Diet Coke.  The menu has a fair amount of variety.  Walls are decorated with jerseys from local sports teams.  I ordered the fish tacos (featured in the Belleville newspaper review) and my wife ordered the Deluxe Calzone.  It took a while for the food to arrive.  Both entrees were served hot.  All food was served in plastic baskets lined with paper.  The biggest challenge to eating the two items is fluid management.  The Deluxe Calzone was particularly juicy.  When my wife cut it open, it kinda ran all over the inside of the basket and pooled at the bottom with no place to escape.  Near as we could tell, it was from the tomatoes in the calzone.  The crust got very damp and fell apart.  My wife finished it with a knife and fork.  It was well nigh impossible to pick up.  The fish tacos were a much better choice, but they also had a bit of an excess fluid problem, but not as much as the Deluxe Calzone.  The diner must race to finish the tacos before the soft taco wraps fall apart from moisture.  The tacos were well-seasoned and had melted cheese inside.  The fish were solid tenderloins and were very tasty.  When the server came to present the bill, my wife brought up the problem with the calzone and how it might have been better served on some kind of plate so it would drain better.  She said simply that everything was served in a basket.

The fish tacos were apparently really popular.  The cook came out of the kitchen and announced to our server that they were out of fish and would not have more until the owner came back tomorrow with more.  Now, if I were in food management, I would get what I needed that night to keep serving the fish tacos -- particularly since they were a featured item in the newspaper.

We're up in the air about returning to Spike's.  I think they are trying fairly hard and are deserving of your consideration.",2015-06-23 00:38:57

I was especially happy that they have PBS channel, because this means my son will be able to watch some kids shows in the morning while we pack - this was great since many hotels we've stayed before did not have PBS or anything suitable for young kids on TV.

The one star missing was for the older, thin towels they provided. They also only have paper cups in the room which was not the best when I wanted to make a cup of tea by boiling water in the microwave. And the indoor pool although seemed nice, they don't open until 10am, then check-out time is 11am so there's not much time for us to enjoy the pool.

CONS: Not the ambiance we were looking for. I know it is an ""old school"" steakhouse, but we were the youngest people there by 20 years -- everyone else appeared retired. The steaks weren't bad but they weren't great; I've done better on my Big Green Egg. They charge St. Louis-style prices without the excitement and energy...environment was a big let down.

It has a small shop with various wine-related gifts and some food items, but you are welcome to bring a picnic basket as well - which is always important to us. We've evolved into avoiding those wineries that no longer allow us to bring in our own cheese. After all, we are there for their wine, not their food.

The pizzas came out and looked good. I found that there wasn't an abundance of toppings on the deep dish. The cruat was very doughy. I prefer it to be a little more crispy and buttery.

I wish I could give it no stars.

I am the mother of a 30 something bride who is smart and savvy.  We did our homework, had IN STOCK gowns on our phones, and made an appointment which we confirmed 30 minutes before we arrived.  We dressed properly and were polite.

They did not have our appointment (which we had JUST confirmed) in the computer.  At all.  The saleswoman then badgered my daughter about her nickname, scolded me (""shame on you!"") for letting my daughter have a nickname, and she told me what she thought of my choice of my daughter's given name.

We just should have left then.  Within one minute the saleswoman offered to undercut the price of any gown we had seen anywhere else.  When I mentioned a specific gown and the price, she denied it existed and made funny noises about the price point.  Whatever.

There are NO 3500 gowns.  They have a second floor we were not allowed to go into.  They IGNORED the IN STOCK gowns we wanted to see.  The saleswoman kept telling my daughter she ""KNEW"" what my daughter wanted.  To be polite, my daughter tried on a gown the saleswoman suggested.  It was awful.  The saleswomen was surprised when she asked me if the bride had tried on any gowns anywhere and I said ""of course"".  My daughter came in prepared, with correct shoes and everything.  Including photos of IN STOCK gowns that we were not allowed to see.

When the saleswoman began reading texts my daughter was sending to me (brief comments about a couple gowns, reminders), that was IT.  We thanked them for their time and left.",2013-06-01 06:13:00

So we had someone come replace the old gutter gaurds. The reason why the edges are wavy is because instead of removing the old gaurds, they nailed them down under the shingles. This made it almost impossible to remove them totally.  The gutter gaurd company did their best but couldn't get it all removed. So, I still have wavy edges.

Students will have the best service here in this college. They have all the students need to complete their assignment even if you are home, students can access the library online. LC staffs are really friendly and they are willing to help student to achieve a better in their classes. 
There is a lot of campus activity if the student love this kind of thing. For sport they have almost have all of it.

There is some classes that are just offered in edwardsville campus. students are really force to go there and take their classes. 

-Tips:-
If you are struggling on writing, you can access the writing center in the library at the main building. They are very nice and friendly, and will help you a lot. I recommend the students go to the student success center because it is free and they will really help you a lot in your studies. be more active on activities so that will make students resume pretty.

==Atmosphere: 5 Star==
This place is so clean. One thing that is bothering for some students is that some building are old and every time you step on the floor students will hear a creaking sound. 


==Cost: 4 Star==
The cost is perfect for everyone its not that high and not too low. it will cause you around $1300 - $2000 per semester. They accept Financial Aid, scholarship and other grants.

==Instructor: 4 Star==
I encounter the best teacher in this campus. but some of my friends didn't. That is the reason why I scored this as 4 star. In my two years studying on this campus, all of the Instructor are very nice and approachable when a student need help.

-Tips:
I recommend Jim Price for being an awesome film art teacher, Dr. Gerald Mozur for logic reasoning, Jenny Margarida for English, Coral Kimble on Math, and Pat Rzewnick for speech class, If you're taking calculus. I recommend Fred Sexton, Open book exam. And he is very approachable and helpful.

As we were enjoying our wine, the amuse bouche arrived and was a cod cake with remoulade.  It was so heavily salted that it was unenjoyable.  We split the Fall salad, which was a tiny mound of lettuces with vinegar and oil and a few crumbles of very salty bleu cheese. It was adequate, but nothing special or particularly delicious.  My entree was scallops with carrots and sun chokes.  The scallops were huge and the presentation was beautiful, but again the food was so overly salted that it was way less enjoyable than it could have been.

The place is clean and staff are friendly but the food is horrible and the tv's played womens golf.  Seriously?

My husband and I were starving and not picky eaters.  The menu pictures looked awesome.  We ordered the Ahi Tuna Crisps appetizer for about $9 but they were dried out fish with toppings on a few tortilla chips (4 to be exact).  There was so little food there.  They lacked any taste.  How they accomplished that I have no idea.

We both ordered the All-American Stacked Burger and the burger was absolutely soaked and dripping in grease (our plates had pools of grease when we picked them up --- about 1/2 cup worth at least on each).  The meat (which we asked for med-rare and pink inside) was well done & then some.  The meat was so dried out from over cooking it was chewy.  I struggled to chew it.  The tomato and lettuce was wilted and so thin you could see thru them both.  They looked nothing like the photos in the menu.  The burger in the menu looks like you get 2 juicy thick (3/4-1"") patties, and what we got looked like a flat pancake (maybe 1/4"" each).

My husband had mango pineapple lemonade and it was so sweet it was hard to drink.

My daughter ordered the children's meal slider cheeseburgers.  There were 2 with french fries, but only one came with cheese (the only barely had a tsp which was melted burnt).  The little slider cheeseburgers were so overly cooked they were as hard as hockey pucks and she could not eat them (even the buns).  I even tried cutting one up, then tried it myself when she could not eat it that way too.  It was awful.  She had not eaten all day and she usually will eat any & everything.  The chocolate milk it came with looked ok but was without chocolate flavor.

Out of the whole set of 3 meals ordered, the only thing we could eat was the french fries & the only drink was my water.

We looked at each other like the whole meal was a bad joke played on us.

It was so bad and off the mark, we are not going back.  For burgers, got to Red Robin.  They are so good and look just like the pictures.  For steaks, Long Horn or Smokey Bones.

I would give 0 stars if I could.  The food is seriously that bad.",2015-10-24 04:10:08

Both entrees came with a dill wedge and housemade potato chips.  Server was very helpful.  The only reason I gave them four stars instead of five is because they were out of chicken.  How could that be?  They also have a line of beer glasses and clothing items with the brewery's logo and the prices were not unreasonable.  I was attracted to the ceramic Red Solo Cup.

I did my research at various dealerships on Sunday so I could look at cars without being distracted by salespeople. On Monday morning, I went back by to look more closely at a few cars I'd selected. Salesman Greg approached me and asked if I had any questions or wanted to test drive anything. He was very friendly and helpful, and he didn't pressure me into doing anything or try to upsell me on features that I didn't need. His focus was on what I was looking for and what would fit my needs the best. Yesterday (Tuesday) I went back in to get my car's value assessed and to negotiate the price with Greg. As this was the first car I was purchasing entirely on my own, I felt a bit nervous, but Greg put me at ease. He never pressured me, and negotiating the price of the car was as simple as talking to him.

I feel great about my purchase and confident in both the car and in Greg. Working in sales myself, I think it's very important to build a relationship with the salesperson. I don't think I could have had a better experience, and I'm so glad not to feel any buyer's remorse -- especially with such an expensive purchase.

So why only four stars? If the service department is as good as Greg told me they are, then this place will be worth a solid five stars. But since I obviously haven't had the car serviced yet, I can't speak to that.

I definitely recommend that anyone looking into a car - new or used, Honda or otherwise - stop by Meyer Honda in O'Fallon and ask for Greg. It never hurts to talk to one more person, and hopefully you'll feel as satisfied and comfortable as I did.",2010-08-25 11:19:27

I refused to make the person in front of me rush, so I waited until she left to order which seemed to annoy the employee. All the staff was speaking loudly and were in constant motion behind the counter, all 10 of them. If you've ever been to a JJ, you know that's a small area. It wasn't a pleasant dining experience. I will not likely dine-in again, but I will definitely order for delivery.",2015-03-05 17:47:48

NAY S checked it out and found a phone number on the item I wanted and he called the company first hand for me and found out that it wasn't and saved me a headache of finding out the hard way when I got home then having to go back and return the item so he found me one that was and they had it!!! All I can say is the effort that he put in and the service I received from him was beyond excellent surprised he wasn't a supervisor to be honest he was the best help I received from any store or place I have ever met that's why I spent time to post a long comment all because of the effort he put in for me I really thankfully that I got to me a great person thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,2014-11-13 04:38:27

2. My face-to-face encounter proves that the people working there are friendly and knowledgeable.

Cons: 
1. Prices are a bit high (this problem is not specific to this store but to the entire company).  For instance, Fable III used is only about $5-10 cheaper at GS than a brand new one at Target.  
2. They don't answer the phone.  I'll call when they first open and even 15 minutes after and even an hour answer and the phone rings ad nauseum.  

All in all, I like the people who work there as they're friendly.  However, when making a purchase decision, I won't use GS unless they're the only one who had an item in the region and when other factors don't matter.

I wanted to really start working on getting myself fit again, physically and mentally. To be honest though I was scared, I had not been in a gym to workout for over 20 years. I was trying to workout at home but I would lose a few pounds and gain it right back, I wasn't getting any stronger either. So I started reading reviews about local gyms and CFE kept popping up as the best around. Still I kept procrastinating. Then I had a chance meeting with one of the owners. We talked about the gym and she told me how to sign up for a free class to try it out. I did my free class, then did some interviews with the owners. I shared my short and long term goals with them. Coach G encouraged me to join the 6 week challenge program they have. It was perfect for me. I had to put some skin in the game with this program. In 6 weeks I lost 18 lbs and 7.5"" from around my waist. I've gained confidence, every day tasks have become easier, I'm more flexible, I'm stronger, and I'm just generally happier.  It's not easy but it is simple. Just follow the program and show up consistently.

The best thing about CFE though is the staff and the other athletes. It really is community, that isn't something they just say. I was so worried I would be in the way of the ""in shape"" people, no one has ever made me feel that way though. The coaches are always there to give you knowledge, or praise, or a push when you need it. Joining the community at CFE was a great decision!!!",2019-11-17 19:26:54

Anyway, we walked in, and it was a pretty hopping place! Lots and lots of 20-somethings there getting their drink (and eat!) on. Many attractive guys. I was a happy girl. 

Anyway, I ordered a Blue Moon (on draft -- delicious!) and...a fried bologna sandwich. Oh yeah. Don't knock it till you've tried it -- I used to LOVE this when I was a kid, so when I saw it on the menu, I just KNEW I had to have it. Only in Granite City, baby...only in Granite City. 

It was served with a side of fries and came out pretty quickly. The bread was toasted, and the bologna -- all three THICK slices of it -- was piled on, along with a healthy slathering of pepperjack cheese sauce. Health food this was NOT, folks! 

The sandwich was rich. Delicious, but I could only down about a third of it before my tummy cried for mercy. I loved every greasy bite that I did consume. 

Best part of the whole thing? It was CHEAP! The sandwich, along with a healthy serving of fries, was less than 6 bucks.

LOVED our salesperson Pamela - we started chatting about our kids and husband's as we were waiting for the manager to get me a better price on a dresser I wanted for my 3 year old son. She got the price lowered for me twice which was Greatly appreciated because I was very happy with the final price. Then she had the guys measure my car trunk to see if I could take away that day and avoid delivery and sure enough it fit! The guys wrapped the dresser and mirror and loaded it in my car with no issues. I did have to get two other things delivered a mirror for my daughter and a table and they had delivery setup within the week which I was very happy about!

The delivery guys were great! There were 4 of them to setup a table and mirror which made me very happy because the process was very quick! They told me I may want to consider buying felt pads for the bottom of the chairs and table legs because they noticed the table and chairs slid a little with the plastic ones on my wood floor. They showed me and explained the care for the furniture and the warranty. Took a picture of the finished table setup and had me sign and left. I honestly couldn't be happier!

Since working in IL, I have only stopped here three times for a morning coffee and some type of breakfast biscuit. This morning when I checked in I was named Duke, with no fanfare. The workers went about with their morning duties as if I didn't exist. Finally someone spoke up and said, ""we'll be with you soon, Sir"". At least I got the respect of being called, Sir. I admit I arrived right as the doors were being opened, (5AM) but stop the morning busy work and give me my coffee. That sounded a little bitchy, sorry about that.

 The new bar, lounge, dining room etc. look and feel great.   The bar area has been made much larger with plenty of High Def flat screens to enjoy your favorite sporting event.  The grounds have always been beautiful so no real room for improvement in that department.  All around this place has been brought up to modern standards and gone is the old stuffiness.  In addition, there are many new menu items and the preparation has been an improvement from the old menu.  I particularly like to new flat breads and other appetizer selections (fried calamari, shrimp martini).  They also serve the best burgers in Belleville.  They normally have a good selection of entrees featuring Steaks, Seafood. Poultry and Pastas.  There is something for every taste except perhaps vegetarians. They need some work in that area along with the entire St. Louis metro area for that matter. 

The service has also gone through a big improvement in 2013 although the evening black bow-ties and vest are too old school formal for my taste.

Went in at 9:30, due to tire pressure light being on. They check pressure, and one is down to 18 pounds (from 35 pounds). I inform the service manager that the light wasn't on last night. He walks up to my car and looks at the tire. Then they fill the tire he tells me to ""keep an eye on it"" and sends me away.

I then spend the next 3 hrs trying to get someone to properly inspect my tire. Meineke saw me, found the hole in the sidewall right away. But didn't have a tire my size in stock.

I go back to Auffenberg, but now it's 2:30 and their service dept is closed.

This could have been taken care of this morning at Auffenberg (where I bought the car 6 months ago), had they checked out my tire like I asked. I told them a tire doesn't lose 17 pounds of air overnight for no reason.

Finally ended up at Dobb's and got a new tire at 3:30.

Yeah, thanks for nothing Auffenberg North.",2016-05-08 04:26:30

It was such a relief to get a new lunch option.  It's conveniently located a few minutes from my job, which makes for a nice change from the ol' sack lunch.

EVERYONE is extremely cordial and helpful....the manager usually steps out to chat as long as they are not inundated with orders/customers.  They recently remodeled as well, which makes the establishment look bigger and more spacious although they have the same amount of sq. footage.  Their prices are incredibly affordable - esp. the various lunch specials.  The service is extremely efficient and fast as well, which works out well for the lunch crowd.

Food quality - I would lean more towards a 3.5 star rating.  It's tasty and hits the spot, but I cannot say it's my all-time favorite Mexican eating destination.  However, they do have great food.  I am partial to the nachos, quesadillas, and burrito/taco/enchilada combos.  You really can't go wrong with any of the delicious lunch combos.   I definitely recommend giving El Torero a shot if you are in the Granite City area.",2011-08-02 18:12:14

Unfortunately, we did not have a great experience there service-wise. I don't think they are used to big groups, because we must have thrown the kitchen in for a loop with our 20 orders coming in at the same time (even though we called ahead to let them know we had a large group.) We waited over an hour for the food to start coming out for some of the people in our party, which came out sporadically in no certain order. I finally received my food after waiting for an hour and a half. The waitress seemed frazzled with the large number of orders and ended up forgetting a few of them. The most frustrating part was that neither the waitress nor the manager came to at least acknowledge/apologize how long we were waiting for the food. I think that could have gone a long way for our frustrated group. 

All of that aside, I had their croquettes which I thought were pretty good. Some people in our party had the fried chicken but didn't like it and thought the portion was too small. Another friend also tried the duck tacos, which he said was good but too small of a portion. 

In summary: I would consider going with a small group or a date. Service is slow... The portions are small and a bit pricey, but much of the food is pretty good. As well, Erato changes their menu frequently, so there might be something different to try each time. There is also a very extensive wine/drinks list.",2012-11-11 02:22:28

I have enjoyed their wings on many occasions, but had ever tried their boneless wings.  Theoretically they should be the same, but how often does that argument fail.

The menu is rather eclectic  - it includes fried fish plates and sandwiches (tilapia, catfish and perch) and different kinds of chicken wings, but it all looks good.  

I had the falafel sandwich - spicy - and a piece of baklava for under 5 bucks.  The falafel was moist and flavorful.  I'll definitely be back!

WRITTEN ON JUNE 27, 2018
I have come here several times over the past year and have always had wonderful experiences! Loek and Danielle are so delightful to work with - very low-key and really know how to help a person have a pleasant experience. In June, they offered BOGO (buy one, get one free) sessions, so I purchased one. When I went in for one of my sessions, Loek told me more than one could be purchased, so I purchased two more. I had used three of the six sessions and went in last night (June 26, 2018) for my fourth. What a nightmare!

Since Danielle & Loek both know me from having been there before, they usually just tell me which float I'm in, and I go back and settle in. Last night, I was greeted by a woman I had never met. She started telling me I had a birthday ""gift"" since yesterday was my birthday. I said ""no, my birthday was last Thursday"". She informed me it had to be either yesterday or today since there was a cupcake next to my name. OK. Fine. I decided not to argue with her. She didn't seem to know what the 'gift' was, so I asked her if I could just call in the morning to discuss it. No, that wasn't alright with her, and she kept right on rambling -- thinking out loud. I asked her two more times, if I could call in the morning since the clock was ticking. (By this time, it was 6:07, since she had stopped to answer the phone at one point.) She accused me of being late. (I walked in at 5:58. If anyone else had been working, I would have been done with my shower and in the float.) I attempted to explain to her that I would have been there sooner, except I had stopped to talk to and then text a person who was letting go of a loved one on life support. She stopped to answer the phone again. (They have voicemail which I usually get when I call them. Why she couldn't take care of the customer in front of her is beyond me.) Finally, by 6:14 pm, she had grabbed a remote and was storming back to the float, shouting that I needed to get in the float and talk to my spirit guides and angels. She's in the float room flicking the lights off and on, still yelling at me about talking to spirit guides. I'm trying to tell her I don't use the lights or music and trying to get her out of there, but she just kept on with her rant. I finally had to yell at her that she's ""preaching to the choir"". By the time she left me alone, I was so stressed out, I couldn't stand it. I went back out and said I wanted to cancel and reschedule. There wasn't anything available at any of the times that would have worked for me, so I ended up doing the float last night. By this time, it was well into the hour for the float. There was music blaring the first five minutes. I was so stressed out, I never could relax and enjoy it and didn't even get the full hour, more like 40 minutes. I took my shower, got dressed and got out of there. 

I had another appointment tonight and two more later in the week. This morning, there was a message on my voicemail from her (turns out, she's one of the owners and is named Sherry) stating that if I was going to be yelling at people tonight, then I'd better not come, and they would refund my money. I only yelled once because she would not listen to me, was argumentative and would not LEAVE ME ALONE! (all caps for emphasis, not yelling. LOL). I emailed her the following: ""I'm choosing to write you instead of calling. I think it would be more productive. I have had no problems with anyone at The Float Center until last night.  Obviously, we have very different personalities that don't mesh well.
I would like to continue coming to your center but would like to do so when other people are working. From what you said on this morning's voice mail, it sounds like you will be working this evening. Please let me know if that's the case so I can make a decision about my appointment.""

After a couple hours and not hearing from anyone, I called. Danielle answered. I asked if she would be working this evening. She said no, that Loek would be there, but Sherry might drop in. My appointment was still on the calendar, so I said I would keep it. After I got off the phone, I got to thinking about it and decided I didn't want to take the risk of running into Sherry. I immediately called, left a voicemail and sent an email. In the reply to my email, they stated they are refunding the $50 for the remaining BOGO but not refunding the $25 for last night's float as that was ""free"". Whatever....

I was planning to do weekly floats, but after this,...no way. They also have lost two new clients I was going to bring in next week. Oh, well!",2018-07-10 01:35:49

This place tops all the fast food places I have had ever!  Let me begin by saying that I love fast food restaurants and Hardees rate high among many.  However, this one incident gave has given me second thoughts of ever going back, at least to this location on east end.  So we go in and ordered the favorite and so delicious bourbon burger combo.  We are handed the number and proceed to have a seat.  Waiting for a few minutes, the food is delivered to our table pleasantly.  Wow!  Does my burger look flat but not to waste time on taking a bite, I dove right in.  My friend is still playing around with the fries and had not noticed the burger just yet.  I, on the other hand, stopped and developed that look on the face of disgust.  You know the face when a baby is given a sour taste!  To my surprise as I look to investigate, there was no meat.  NO MEAT People!!!!!!!!!!  Now to other fast food, like White Castle or McD's, this would not be a big surprise since their meat are small enough to not notice.  But, to Hardees where they advertise 1 pound burger meat.  Come on!!!!  Skip the lettuce or tomato or even sauce, but the meat!  It was laughable if not upsetting.  I go to the counter and present the undesirable.  She was just as shocked as we were.  Come to find out!  They  had a new person in training making the food.  The trainer made this clear by pointing the finger and not blaming himself.  LOL!  So typical!  The lady at the counter gets them to make new ones and even said, ""How do you forget the meat?""  They brought out the new meal.  It was as good as we have had in the past.  I just had to laugh at the experience.  All the workers were young people and, yes, we are all human.

Yes, the menus were printed on paper, but this was just fine since 1) It's know for its wings, not its filet mignon; and 2) It is in the opening stages.  My first observation was that the walls were a bit bare, but the dozen or so flat screens made up for that.

My wife and I were greeted and seated almost immediately.  There was a couple ahead of us.  Our server was polite as she made a few recommendations and notified us of the specials for the night.

The wings were great!  We thought it was awesome that we did not have to order a set amount of wings per flavor (we were able to mix and match).  Between the both of us, we tried 4 different flavors (lemon pepper was our favorite).  The fries were different, but tasty, nonetheless.  For desert, we had the funnel cake fries.  Yes, the portion size was small, but they tasted amazing with the ice cream.  I don't recall the price, but I'm sure I did not pay $5 for them.

Overall, this is a really good place for food and watching sports.  I think it may have the potential to eventually be great, especially being so close to SIUE and open late night.

Rated it 4/5 stars, because there's so much potential for this place to succeed.

Will be returning soon!  Maybe I will try a burger next time..",2012-04-04 21:08:46

I always enjoy visiting my local Houlihans in Fairview Heights. I was running errands and realized it was Tuesday and I wanted to try their new 612 stuffed burger that is only available on Tuesday. Well today was the day and it didn't disappoint!

My server Tony was fantastic and pointed out the burger as a special today and I told him that was exactly what brought me in for my visit. ( and my 20% off email coupon!)

To wet my palette, I started off with a strawberry guava iced tea (Tony was nice enough to accommodate me asking him to mix 2 syrup flavors) and I highly recommend doing that! It was delish!

My burger came out and it looked great. Fries were hot and perfectly cooked, burger looked picture perfect. 

The burger is stuffed with white cheddar, worcheshire sauce and a ""secret ingredient"" and the promo photos show this oozing center of this well cooked burger that makes you want to dance! 

Well it was a bit of a let down when I slice open my burger with the big reveal looking for the ooze and no oozey cheese. But it was cool, it was still good. I love that dijonnaise sauce on the bun- that was so flavorful and delicious! I also love the way the lettuce was shredded...I don't think they do that for all their burgers but they should. It wasn't shredded like cheap Taco Bell shredded lettuce but it just was very complementary to the burger.

Once again my experience at Houlihans was outstanding! The environment was clean neat and fresh smelling, Tony as a server was fantabulous, and my food was deliciously prepared perfectly. 

I love how Houlihans corporate really takes the time to shake up their menu seasonally so you can still enjoy your favorites on the menu, but if you want to try something new, you can. They do a great job of having something on their seasonal menu that appeals to everybody. You may not want to try everything, but there is at least one thing that makes you say, ""Hey! I want to try that!"" 

I will be back to try the creme brûlée flight- the chocolate rhubarb and the butterscotch sounded phenomenal! But I indulged enough today with the burger. Until next time Houlihans in Fairview Heights, keep up the good work!",2017-10-24 20:18:21

Who doesn't enjoy beautifully decorated, fresh baked, moist cupcakes? Well Smallcakes in Fairview Heights is open and I am excited Fairview has a sweet shop of its own on the main I-159 corridor. It's a little further down past Krispy Kreme if you are traveling south, but it is GREAT I can stop there for a sugar fix when I am doing shopping in the area. The place is beautiful and new, clean and pristine and you are greeted with a smile and cheerful hello upon entering! The staff is friendly and informative and I love patronizing places where people seem to love where they work and have a passion for talking about their products. 

I always have to get the basics- a yellow cupcake with buttercream. I find chocolate has a tendency to mask ""eh"" products, and people who love chocolate tend to focus on their love of chocolate over the actually taste of the product the chocolate is in. Also chocolate cake tends to be a more moist cake just because of the combo of ingredients and how they bake together. White or yellow cake can't be masked. If it is dry, flavorless and nasty you will know. That is NOT the case with Smallcakes! Now remember it is a franchise concept, and although each one is locally owned and operated, there is still a standard across all locations and this doesn't disappoint. 

Please patronize this place! I love Woods bakery in O'Fallon and I love The Cup in Edwardsville, but as much traffic that passes through Fairview Heights, let's keep this place going! Check this place out and support them! 

Please keep up the standards, Smallcakes Fairview Heights team! Don't make me regret my glowing review in 6 months!",2018-01-10 22:22:22

I was able to look around the dining area and see that most of the tables needed wiping down. The trash cans were full. There was debris's on the floor. The soda machines look to be in disrepair they were missing faceplates and generally  looked like crap. The catchup dispensers both of them were in operable. As we walked through the doors we could look down behind the counter and see a pile of trash right around the drive-through window that the crew apparently was cleaning up but you could still see trash on the floor there. I was with the group and every person I was with stated the same things how dirty the place was tonight. I noticed that the Redbox machine was gone. In the small alcove where it once stood there was a ladder and various other things that probably should've been put away in the back. It was very disappointing their regional or local managers need to look at this and correct it. This is how people get fired.,2016-04-23 03:15:16

My turn was no different: no greeting. I asked if anyone was there and they came back with ""you can order when you're ready."" The previous customer's order was still on screen. When they started adding my order i alerted her that there was extra food. She apologized and deleted each item...it sounded like there was then confusion ahead of me in line...

After trouble in the line and getting cold fries: I pulled out of the drive opened my chicken sandwich and it was cold, rubbery, and all in disarray with mayonnaise everywhere inside the box. I finally gave up and went elsewhere Without eating anything.

First of all he had my car for over 3 weeks. It took me doing research online to track down the problem for him that he couldn't figure out. That should've been my first warning. Not very knowledgeable.

I asked him to do a complete tune-up, flush and fill, and an oil change on the vehicle. As cruddy as the anti-freeze looked just a few months later, I have my doubts that part was done. The oil change was written nowhere on the receipt, so that never got done. But it's the spark plugs I have a real issue with.

For 6 spark plugs I was charged $271.88 for parts and labor. As with any transverse engine, the back 3 plugs are extremely difficult to get to. That explains the high labor cost. However, because it's so difficult to check that they were actually changed, some, less than honest mechanics, will simply skip all the work but charge for it anyway. That's what happened in my case. 

I was cheated and robbed, and would NEVER trust this guy around one of my cars EVER again. I caution anyone that goes here to make sure the work he charges for was actually done. ALWAYS ask for your used parts back, and when you can, actually watch them do the work.",2016-03-28 22:31:31

After looking through the contract, my lawyer specifically said the owner has loopholes for everything to ensure that you can't get out of the contract without paying ridiculous fee's.

The worst part of my experience was that I was told by the owner himself that as long as I cancelled before the next billing cycle on the 15th, I wouldn't be charged again. I went into cancel on the 1st of the month, the associate told me that she did so, and I didn't go back again. Four months later I was served with an outrageous bill stating that I failed to make payments. Funny because in all that time I wasn't notified once that I had missed a payment, and I had been told that my account was cancelled.

When I went in to speak with the owner, he wouldn't say two words to me and told me to ""speak with his attorney.""

When I first signed up I was fed lies about how great of a deal I was getting and he even threw in discounts because I attend SIUE. This man parades around acting like he is so nice and helpful to college students, when in reality he makes his money by ripping us off. He may have satisfied customers but that is ONLY because they haven't tried to leave yet and I feel sorry for when they do because they are in for a nasty shock,

They'd all come in for oil changes and had been there for hours because the mechanics had ""found serious problems"" with their cars.  One woman had been there for 6 hours for a 3 year old car (finishing with a $1400 bill).  It became apparent that Midas lures you in and then pushes for tons of other repairs.  

The mechanic had me follow him into the garage area (1 hour after I arrived) and showed me all of the ""serious problems"" my vehicle supposedly has.  He said I must be leaking oil (which I've never seen on my driveway), my tires were ""shot"", etc.  I said no thanks, just do my oil change and rotation.  They gave me an estimate anyway for $1300 which didn't even include new tires.  When I went to pay, there was confusion about whether they used the synthetic oil or not.  I honestly never saw them CHANGE my oil or filters.  Plus I said I didn't see them rotate my tires.  The cashier said they couldn't rotate them because I hadn't followed their advice about needing new tires and it was dangerous.

That's the feeling I got when I stayed here for 2 weeks. I love the amenities and coziness of this hotel! Nice gym with new machines, free washer and dryer, a mini-market for your convenience, and a DVD library in the lobby. I'd be sold already just by hearing that their laundry facility is free! I especially liked how there are a lot of choices of restaurants to try out near by. 

First off, my colleague and I were fortunate that they had rooms available for us at last minute due to a bad incident at another hotel close by. I was placed in a handicap room because it was the only one available at the time. So the bathroom shower stall was wheelchair accessible. The room was great for being an extended stay hotel. Complete with a 2-range stove-top, microwave, dishwasher, a regular size fridge, and all the necessities you need in a kitchen (such as pots, pans, wine bottle opener, etc.) you almost feel like you're in a mini-apartment. 

Some other things I liked was their updated warm and modern furniture. They give you plenty of hangers, and their iron was clean (no crusty water residue left from previous use). The placement of the desk/dining table made it a perfect spot to get work done or eat dinner. The room comes with a DVD player. The mattress was firm yet comfy. And the bathroom was huge in terms of floorspace. 

My only gripes were that the vanity in the bathroom was small (see picture attached) - I didn't have a whole lot of room for all of my most important beauty products. And if you don't turn off the shower head while you're soaping yourself or washing your hair, the floor will get wet all the way to the toilet. Luckily there's a big drain in the middle of the floor, but the water won't drain unless you swept it in with your extra towels. I had to waste a few just to use them as floor mats. Also the bathroom sink faucet was the kind of faucet you see in a public restroom - you have to keep pressing it to turn it on, and it won't stay on unless you keep pressing it. Imagine how long it took to finish up in the bathroom without the luxury of constant running water. On the other hand, it's a good way for the hotel to conserve water, so it didn't totally suck when you think of being ""green"". Also, my room was right behind the elevator. So the whole time I was thinking my neighbor's heater was loud every time it came on. Turns out, there's no room on the other side if the wall - it's the elevator being used each time! I had to get used to waking up to the sound of the elevator going up and down. 

The front desk people are helpful. The gentleman was nice enough to help me lug all of my suitcases out to my car. I really appreciated that. I would definitely look into staying at other Candlewood Suites in the future.",2010-11-23 04:51:08

Second, once I realized this mistake and ordered a pair of shoes, we picked out the color i wanted but I had to come back later to have them dyed.  I come back and they have no idea what I'm talking about and I had to choose a color again (There are 6 different shades of ivory) 
Third, one of my bridesmaid dresses came in with an oil stain so it had to be returned.
Fourth, one of the flower girl dresses was defected and tried telling my mother in law it was okay and refused to fix it. When she took it to another seamstress she agreed that it was defective.
5th two of my bridesmaids shoes were dyed incorrectly. Fortunately my NY bridesmaid sent her shoes to us (they were correctly dyed) and the maids who got theirs dyed in Fairview could tell theirs were wrong and get it fixed days before the wedding.

Review:
This is a nice little place over by Wang Gang, Joe's Pizza, and Subway and a couple other places.  It used to be a Japanese place, but it's been re-done with pictures of the islands, beaches, toucans, and Jimmy Buffet music.  Some of the decorations are a little cheesy and only a few look professionally done, but it's really part of the whole theme, so I didn't mind it too much. The waitress we had was super nice.  We were also the ONLY ones in there, which was weird.

I went here for lunch last week with some work mates and we all got different plates, but I think everyone was happy.  

For appetizers, we ordered empanadas and two orders of chips/salsa. With the chips, we got two kinds of salsa, the mango kind and the ""Smoke Damage"" kind.  My co-worker who likes spicy stuff said it was a little too hot for her, so we switched to the Pico de Gallo salsa. The mango one was really good, but needed something extra.  The empanadas were about 5-inches long and filled with your choice of chicken or shrimp AND some kind of cheesy sauce. I was not expecting the cheese or for them to be deep fried. (hello, read the menu!) But, they were still good. I wouldn't order them again because I'm a freak and don't like cheese or deep fried stuff, but I'm guessing a lot of people will like them. My workmates liked 'em!

For lunch, we had a few different things. The most expensive thing on the menu is a steak at $14.95. No one got that.  Two gals ordered the Caribbean K-bobs ($9.95) - one with chicken and one with shrimp, both with lots of veggies. Both looked and smelled fantastic and got great reviews, I think this is what I'll get the next time I come back.  One gal ordered a jerk burger ($7.95) (which was good, but I think she was shocked at the bun. It's not a regular hamburger bun.) and two gals got B.A.L.T.'s ($6.95 each), which also got good reviews and looked really good. One of them got fries, which looked sorta like Wendy's fries. (which, if you like Wendy's, isn't a bad thing at all!)  I got the Veggie Overload salad ($7.50) (which lasted for four days - they have HUGE portions.) It was fantastic because there are so few places where you can get a spinach salad! (I'm not from the Midwest, so adjusting to the food here has been a challenge.)

We were having a bit of a work meeting and asked them to turn down the music (which was blaring out of a speaker directly over our heads), and they happily did so.  Our waitress brought extra napkins and refilled the glasses without having to be asked. (again, the place was empty, but I think she was pretty good nonetheless.)

I will definitely go here again as it seems to be one of a few places that have different and healthy stuff, but also serves burgers and fries. They have a good kids menu, too. I think this would be a great place to bring kids because of the bright colors, easy to eat foods, happy staff, and since it's not too quiet, you don't have to worry about someone getting fussy and turning heads. :o)

And I must say that as a former Hawaii resident, I'm happy to have anything tropical around.  I'm a little worried about it being so empty at noon, though.  I hope it sticks around.",2013-05-10 15:02:09

Absolutely horrid experience. Before I explain what happened, I want to make it known that I attempted to dispute this with Savvi through their website roughly one month ago and have not received a response. 

I was a groomsman at my good friend's wedding and rented a tux from Savvi for the event. I was extremely disappointed with my entire experience, as the suit did not fit correctly from top to bottom. The jacket was too small in the shoulders and too wide in the lower torso. I couldn't even cross my arms. I actually told this to the gentlemen who had me try it on and all he could offer was giving me a larger size jacket, which would not solve this proportionality issue. I obviously said no. In addition, the pants were too baggy, too long, and hardly fit around my waist. I noticed this when I tried it on as well but figured I could wear a belt, only to discover these pants were not designed with belt loops. No matter what I did, my pants became looser and looser throughout the evening. It was extremely embarrassing to have to HOLD MY PANTS UP AT THE ALTER. I walked awkwardly down the aisle, stood uncomfortably, and nearly dropped my pants walking back. It was one of the most embarrassing experiences of my life. I was stuck sitting in a chair for the remainder of the night because I was terrified of my pants falling off on the dance floor. 

I'm not sure why they even bothered to measure me. Nothing fit. I could have used the money I spent to BUY a brand-new suit of decent quality that would have fit better.

My taste in home furnishings are fairly traditional, with a slight lean towards country and NFHF fulfills them with a large selection. In addition to styles on display in the store, you can order from manufactures catalogs. 

Keep in mind, many of the items and brands at NFHF are made to order and are not sitting in a warehouse waiting to be delivered. If you want quality, you need to be patient. Good things comes to those who wait. 

The Sales Professionals here are down-home friendly, no high pressure selling like you get at most furniture stores where the sales people work on straight commission. They listen to your likes, request, price range and guide you to the best selections available in house or via special order. 

Delivery is not free, there is a minor fee, but it is worth the price.  The men who have done all my deliveries have been courteous and respectful of my home.

The portions tend to be large (except for some of the sides) and I can usually eat half of the meal the first day and finish the meal as my dinner the next day.  The staff has been kind and courteous each and every time my husband and I have gone through the drive-thru together, and according to my husband, they are just as kind each time he goes alone.  My personal favorite on the menu is the grilled tilapia meal, but so far I haven't tried anything I didn't like.  We don't usually buy appetizers when we eat out, but we do at D's.  I usually get the clam strips every time, and when they have the fried pickles, which sound gross but are heavenly for all of the salt lovers out there - like me. I usually get an order of the pickles every day - even when I'm not having D's for dinner.  Overall, Captain D's does a good job serving seafood in the middle of the country, at the same time as providing good service.  I know I will continue dining here all my days.

The cons: place is very poorly managed,  terrible service, bartender was alone with dozens of people waiting for drinks, waited 13 minutes to order a drink, no prices shown on the wine menu (?). I asked where the extra help was and he said another bartender was coming later. She did, however, then he left so the problem continued. 

Since the place is huge I asked where the birthday party was but the bartender did not know so we just had to walk around to find someone in the party we knew.  Our party planner had met with a VM rep and had a designated area for us. 

It was very telling that the parking spot right at the entrance was marked: MANAGER PARKING.  Another reviewer said the review from SP is actually the owner giving the winery 5 stars.  I get the picture.",2013-03-18 20:12:35

First off Apple direction were spot on. The site, a patch of grass, fire ring and picnic table. (Perfect)So no unusual wear and tear on my kit. You do not have some glorious view but I am not here for that besides this place is really about proximity so keep reading about the shuttle.
Pool looked fun but I was beat. 
Laundry was reasonable but make sure you bring liquid soap. No powder or crystals ( not sure on Pods.) 2.50w/2.00d
The whole place was clean and seemed well run. Showers are combination not coin driven, I have been burned by this so I asked. Believe me a plus. 
I missed the restaurant, looked great but closed at 8.
Met a sweet family traveling who shared some grilled chicken, touched my heart.  Local noises did drop off a lot after 10pm.
They offer a very reasonable round trip shuttle to St Louis. Looked like 10/20 depending on locations and a small up-charge depending on number of party. Not a big deal as it is round trip. 
All in All clean, looked well managed and located close to some great sites. Lots of happy campers were in my view.
WiFi worked but it is for all, so slow service makes sense but really get your faces out of the screens and live like we did in the 1990!
Anyways I am heading to the rack. All quite is at 10 and so far lots of respectful campers. 
That is what really make anyplace worth a stay so stay classy Yelpers!
Quick update: super clear showers and bathrooms
I was leaving and I believe I met the owner and without sounding too sappy, super nice and helpful with an unexpected need. A++ service I bumped it all the way to five!",2018-07-08 02:27:57

Their cardio selection is quite large. As for weights, it's got a good variety but it's not going to blow your mind or anything. That being said, if you can't do all the work you need to do in this place, that says more about you than the gym!

They also have a juice bar that is very reasonably priced and they will make you essentially whatever you want and it tastes great.

Finally, the manager, who I believe is Logan, was incredibly friendly. I talked to him on the way in and out and he made me feel welcome even though it was my first time. He was even kind enough to let me scan the ingredients he put into my smoothie so I could track calories.

1st-day--they said no, stating that we do not take care of the animals we got. hogwash. my dog is 16 how could she live that long if we don't take care of her. she did not get an optional shot. that at her age was not a big deal. so i asked if i got her the shot could i still get the dog. the girl said yes. so, i took the proof up there for them to see. 

2nd-day--they said that i had to take the older dog up there for a meet and greet with the new dog.when we walked in they had the dog i wanted in with another couple. being 16 she did not want anything to do with the younger dog. so the guy was a little rude about saying no. just rude enough to make me cry from disappointment.

i realize that they want the best for the animals.but  the application was like filling out a loan application. and it is almost easier to get a credit card than a dog from here. i would not discourage anyone from getting a dog from a shelter, even from this one. I think i will stick with going to st. Louis humane society, if you want a dog from here make sure you are married and have no other animals. 

BTW ......i did get a puppy off of craigslist. yes i did pay too much for a mutt(shepard mix).

Jack Schmitt is the second dealer we went to, but it should have been the first. We knew we wanted a Volt, and the first dealer we went to used a bait-and-switch internet ad to lure us in. We decided to keep looking and came across the perfect option at Jack Schmitt. Not only was the price similar to what we wanted at the other dealer, but we got leather, navigation, a back-up camera, and more for the price of a base model at the other place, and they did everything they could from a financing standpoint to get us the best interest rate and loan terms. 

We were already thrilled, but the awesomeness didn't end there. It had been raining when we test drove the car, so we hadn't noticed that one of the Volt decals was cracked (totally weird). Tim, who was not our sales person, but who helped us out as we were leaving, reminded us to come back to have the car detailed (it had been raining, so it hadn't been done). I pointed out the cracked decal and mentioned that it was going to bother me. Tim took note, and before I had a chance to come back in for detailing, he called to tell me a new decal had arrived. Today I brought the car back, and now it's completely perfect, new decal and all!

Everyone we worked with at Jack Schmitt Chevrolet was fantastic, from the non-pushy sales people to finance to the service department. They treated us right, gave us a great deal, and put us in a car we will love for many years to come. Two thumbs up from me!",2017-07-21 18:05:21

Where do I start??

This is why people sneer and say, ""Midwest? Oh, you can't get good seafood there."" And as having lived my entire life in the Midwest, I always say, ""Yes you can. You just have to know where to look."" But not at Catch 22.

Catch 22 bills itself as an upscale restaurant. It certainly is with the price range, with the lowest entree on the menu being $11 and most of the entrees being in the high teens to $35. It definitely is not pretentious either in decor or manner. But I don't know if I would call it upscale. The decor is very minimalist, but doesn't do anything to the restaurant. It's as if someone painted, but forgot the decorating. It's also very dark. Not ambient or cozy, but dark. I actually give props to the serving staff for not bumping into things. It's very roomy in front, but the eating area is super crowded. I guess, part of it is how the building is, but it's just a weird setup. 

The serving staff is very nice, but they are very easily overwhelmed. I had hoped with them being in business for awhile, that this would work itself out, but not really. The more people, the more confused they become, especially if those people are in groups. I think part of it is also the kitchen staff because they are always behind. I've been there when people have left because the wait was too long. 

The menu now notes that sandwiches are not available after 4 pm. That's good. On one occasion, I tried to order a shrimp po'boy and was told smartly that they don't serve it at dinner. Well, it wasn't marked; I don't have ESP. On another occasion, a friend tried to order it and was told that they were out of it. Really? At lunch? Sigh. Now they're only open for lunch on Fridays and Sundays, and there's brunch offerings somewhere. Those po'boys are harder to find than a HP touchpad. 

All the dishes I've tried tend to be on the fishy side. I feel that most of the seafood has been previously frozen. The scampi is definitely generous on the butter. Oh yes, and I remember the first time I was there, they ran out of choices on the sides. 

I like the fact that it is not a chain, but I really wish the owner(s) would focus on a niche. Choose a couple of things, and make it stand out. Is it a bar? Is it a upscale restaurant? They're doing a chocolate lounge thing nowadays too, and honestly, there is no sense of identity anywhere.",2011-10-21 06:51:31

Both kitchen and waitstaff. Not a huge problem. For the price, I can deal with a little inconvenience. However, what I do NOT like having to deal with is watching the owner(? Manager? Not sure who he was) chastise the waitress publicly (who did great, she just seemed new to the job). This happened twice, in earshot of most of the customers, and is really unprofessional. Not for her, but for him. Take this kind of crap behind closed doors. I felt awful for her and embarrassed to have overheard their conversation, especially with the untone he took. Word of advice, if you want people to come back, treat your staff with kindness. Most people don't care if a waitress makes a small mistake. A good attitude can make you forget a lot of things. One thing that's hard to forget is bad management. If you want good people to work for you, you will need to treat your people with respect. Otherwise you will fail like so many other restaurants.

Round two: I don't know why we went back. Our waitress was not around because she admitted that she forgot all about us. We kept having to ask the bus boy for refills or whatever else we needed. He was awesome. The waitress was not. And, yet again, the manager was yelling at his employee as we left.

The pizzas we got were piping hot but really, they smell better than they taste. They weren't bad; they just had virtually no flavor. Nothing special, and frankly, a tad pricey for being so bland.

My other problem was with the means of payment. I ordered online and submitted, but somewhere in submission, the order software erased all of my delivery information and defaulted to a carry out order. I'm tech savvy, and this app took me nearly 30 minutes to order between hopping between options and different menu items. Regardless, I noticed and called them immediately. The kid on the phone changed this to delivery but then called me back saying he needed my credit card to add the delivery fee. Now, I'm in a business that does delivery. Had we already had a customer with some hassle, who had to call in, hung up and then you have to call him/her back for credit card info for a delivery fee...yeah, I probably would've said forget the delivery fee this time. Didn't happen, and that's okay. I have no issue paying for what I get. However, the kid, apparently, charged the whole thing to my credit card, and without realizing this had happened, I gave the driver cash to pay for it. Now, through all this, we got this situation settled, and my boyfriend went to pick up my cash the following week. However, my money sat there for two-to-three days. I had to call them when I contacted my credit card company about the TWO charges on my credit card---once a partial payment of $10---which is what I had intended all along--through the app and once for the WHOLE amount...AND they had my cash. When I called Sunday to talk to someone, I was told no manager would be in until Monday at 11 but he would leave a message to call me. Well, my lunch hour rolled around---well after 1:30 PM, and the charges were still there, they still had my money, and I'd still not heard from a manager. So...I called my credit card company. They 3-way'd in the manager, and we talked about it. He said he was confused why I'd sent cash, but instead of calling me, they just stuck it in the safe....for three days. They had my number on my order, in the computer, and to call me back to charge me for delivery, but no one thought to call when the driver returned with cash, and they were confused? Regardless, we picked up the cash, and the partial payment wasn't charged to my card after all was worked out. 

Being in business, myself, I can absolutely appreciate them handling a sticky situation professionally. That is what got the extra two stars. The lack of action regarding that issue and the not-so-hot pizza only garnered the one.",2016-02-01 22:56:20

I plan I giving them another shot, but upon our first visit, we were shopping for Special Needs ladies for a chaperoned summer trip. Their plus size availability was dismal. It was mainly work out pants. We had to have those two ladies wait until we went to a different store, like Cato, so we could find them appropriate outfits. My biggest complaint was trying on clothing. As staff, each of us was assigned to two ladies. Because two were plus sized and had nothing to try on, we had three staff members to help four ladies. However, we were absolutely smothered by the staff and security at the dressing rooms. I understand controlling loss. However, because we needed to but three full outfits for each lady and had multiple options for both tops and bottoms, the incredibly strict number of items made this a very difficult trip. We didn't want to steal anything! We just wanted to compare the blue and black tops!  You also couldn't be IN the dressing room without a number on a card saying how many items you have. We were assisting ladies with special needs that needed help putting certain things on or whatnot. Because they were changing it was difficult to switch pieces in and out to keep our number of items IN the dressing room to six or less, and by insisting we have the ""number of items"" card while in the dressing room, we finally had to have all three staff with one lady at a time. We couldn't take the ""0"" ""number of items"" card outside of the dressing room with us, so when I ventured out into the store for a replacement top and came back to a totally different attendant, I got to explain myself and the situation all over again. The folks at Burlington also preferred six items or less but understood what we were doing AND the situation and worked with us. They were present but not hovering, overbearing, and difficult to work with. Stopping at Ross added an extra hour and a half to our trip merely because of the hoop jumping in the dressing room.",2014-05-09 03:15:06

It is in a small building in downtown Edwardsville; they have a very small parking lot, but allow a few extra minutes to find parking if that is full.

There were several interesting choices on the menu, with food items not commonly seen elsewhere.  I had the Cornish pasty, which was very good: a tasty filling with a mild but distinct flavor, surrounded by a crispy crust.  The House Side Salad was also good, with a mild balsamic vinegar dressing.  I had English Breakfast tea, which was steeped in a nice large-one-serving tea pot. 

My wife had the ""Bit of Everything"" (the contents of which can be found in the Queen's website's online menu), and found it to be quite good.  She had a seasonal tea, which she also liked.

We shared two desserts: a Victorian layer cake, and a lemon-blueberry scone; both were quite tasty, and unusual.  We also tried the ""clotted-cream"", and a lemon garnish; both added to the dessert experience, at least with our particular two items.

Service was quite good on this not-too-busy day; we arrived for our 12:30 reservations, with few other diners present.  A few other groups came in by 1 PM.  An oddity, is ordering up at the counter, but having the food brought to the table when ready.  I would have preferred full table service, but perhaps this setup is common in England.

The decor was simple but tasteful, with British photos and items on display.

Prices were moderate, in line with other ""nice"" lunch places.

There is also an afternoon tea offered on certain days; we plan to try that at some time.

Overall, we enjoyed Queen's Cuisine, and plan to return when we want a rather unique food experience.",2017-10-11 02:46:06

I adopted my two dogs from Spencer.  Spencer is very easy to work with, and adoption was a breeze.  Of course, you need to submit an application and be chosen as a match to get your new pet. 

They post their available pets on PetFinder so you can look over the animals available for adoption before coming for a visit.

Knowing last night that today would be a gorgeous day, my friends and I decided on going golfing somewhere near St. Louis. Our criteria for the ideal location was somewhere inexpensive (including golfing with a cart--as we're immatures/amateurs), somewhat close, not too crowded, and somewhere where we could enjoy the sunshine. This Far Oaks Golf Club fit the perfect bill for all of these.
We were able to book a tee time without any difficult for mid-afternoon. We each paid only $22 for 18 holes, and this price included the cart fee! 
In terms of golfing, we had an challenging though incredible amount of fun. We got better as the day went along, and I think part of why we could get better was because the course is difficult but not outlandish. There are red, white, blue, and black tees; we chose the white which offered a very fair challenge for our skillset (well...lack thereof). The course weaves in and out of neighborhoods with beautiful houses, and there are several dog-legs both left and right. The par 3s were my favorite because birdies are doable on all of them--and I even got one! 
The course was not crowded on this day, and I doubt it is crowded most days as it is somewhat out in the middle of nowhere. Our group of 4 allowed a few groups to play through us, and we still finished in about 4.5 hours. Like the previous reviews stated, there are no/few marshalls, but that didn't affect us negatively at all.
The club inside has a large food and drink selection, and the golf shop is everything you'd expect it to be. One thing I didn't see out on the course was a water stand, which would have been nice. Other than that though, no real complaints from this guy.
Great job, Far Oaks! I'll be back shortly!",2014-03-12 02:59:40

Everything is self serve. Rock music is way too loud. But the prices: $10+ for the regular sized cheeseburger, $4 for small fries, $3 for soda, add tax and modest tip and you're over $20! I'll spend half that somewhere else and be just fine.",2021-09-28 15:41:34

On first glance, the shop is not the most aesthetically pleasing--posters of hands and feet with glammed out nails were covering every wall and there was an odd fountain in the corner. However, the looks shouldn't deter you from the great service! There were around 8 people working at the time and we were quickly seated and drawn hot water. I asked for hot water, but when it was too hot to put my feet in, the woman who was doing my moms pedi (later I found her to be the owner) quickly rushed over and put in some cold water to even the temperature. There was a decent selection of polish, however I've seen better options. Mostly OPI though so definitely quality colors. 

Down to the quality--the young girl who did my nails was super talkative and friendly and my mom and I absolutely loved getting to know her! The pedi itself was spectacular as well. For $20 we got a basic pedi which included nail trim, cuticle care, skin care, massage, hot towel, and polish. Not to mention the time that was spent--each of our sessions lasted about 30 min and great care was taken to be sure we knew what would be going on each step of the way.

I took my dog there to do a heartworm test once. However, when our sweet boy Zeke was at the end of his time we called both vets to see who would be more reasonably priced for the 'procedure'. Hawthorne was a little pricier, but Troy Vet Clinic wanted us to pay an office visit fee for them to see him before they would agree to the 'procedure'. We opted for Hawthorne, and we were glad. They were so kind and respectful during that very difficult time. Now, we're watching my sister's dog for an extended time and we want to get his shots and heartworm test. So, Troy Clinic was going to be more reasonable than Hawthorne (minimal office visit fee when doing vaccinations). So, even though we had been put off by their attitude with our Zeke situation, off we went to Troy Vet Clinic. They had never seen this dog. They have only seen my other dog for a heartworm test, so we don't really have a feel for the staff there, and I've never even met the vet. Although, when I stopped in a while back to get some heartworm medicine, I spoke with the girl at the front desk and was told that my brand of choice had been discontinued but that they had Heartgard. I asked her if the active ingredients in the Heartgard are the same as the ones in my old brand, as I knew my dog's system did well on the old brand. I could see by the flash of inner confusion on the girl's face that she had no idea what the active ingredients were. However, she must have decided that it was easier to come up with an answer than to try to figure it out, so she piped up ""Yes!"". When I asked her what that active ingredient was, she got that confused look again. So, I gave her my best ""You just LIED and we both know it"" look. I checked, no they aren't the same. I guess it's a good thing that I was asking because I'm overprotective and not because my dog is freakishly allergic, because that invented answer could have been a big problem. So, needless to say, the staff at Troy Vet Clinic haven't earned our trust yet. The vet tech who saw us for our vaccinations was extremely young and unsure. She announced that she would take my dog to the back to do all the vaccinations and the heartworm test, and I very politely stated that I wished to remain with him while they did what they needed to do. That startled her. She said all her equipment was in the back room, so I offered to follow her to the back room, or suggested that she could bring her 'equipment' to the exam room. She went mildly fluttery and stuttery and had to go out and check with someone else. She returned to tell me that I could not remain with my pet because it was against policy. She cited insurance issues as the reason. I was adamant about not turning my pet over to people who were increasingly causing me alarm, and my husband was very upset. He explained to her that the dog is part of our family and that the staff had done nothing to earn our trust yet. Some discussion later, we ended up leaving vowing never to return. The staff just doesn't exhibit the regard for our family members that we feel they should. So, skip forward a few days. I receive a certified letter from the vet at Troy vet clinic saying that yada yada obviously we are unhappy with their service and don't trust them yada yada yada and we should find a new vet. No kidding? That's just what I was thinking. I absolutely DON'T trust them with my beloved animals, and I absolutely WILL find a different vet. There was absolutely no chance that I was ever going back there, but they felt it necessary to spend $6.11 to send a certified letter divorcing themselves from a potential client, essentially trying to punish me for being a voice and advocate for the members of my family who have no voice. I find their behavior extremely disturbing, very arrogant, and not at all in the best interest of pets and the people who love them. I will heartily recommend AGAINST Troy Veterinary Clinic and Dr. Julie Mears to anyone who asks. I miss my old vet who didn't charge outrageous office visit fees when they weren't needed, who greeted my dog with a big smile and open arms, and who I trusted to treat her with love and respect at all times, whether I was there watching over his shoulder or not. I miss my old vet whose goal was healthy happy animals not paying off his student loans or shuffling as many dogs as possible through his office every day. I miss my old vet who spoke to me about my dog's care, not in little placating words, but about research and biology and physiology. If anyone knows a vet like that in the area, please let me know. In the meantime, if you're in Troy, I recommend you visit Hawthorne Animal Hospital (and I recommend them over Troy Vet Clinic without ever having met the new vet at Troy Hawthorne!).",2013-10-04 04:02:57

The Chicago pizza arrived incredibly gooey - they didn't skimp on the cheese! But I wanted it a little more firm so I asked if it could be put back in the oven. A cook (manager?) came out and politely explained that he couldn't bake it any longer or it would burn. So I asked for a regular style pizza and that one arrived cooked to our liking.

Food is 4-stars, but service is a bit quirky and tough to figure out for rookies.   Sit in the bar area, you go get your drinks separately at the (not at the grill).  Sit in the dining area, waitress will get your drinks.

Cheap wings for happy hour one day a week....pizza is pretty legit!

They don't maintain a solid website or FB page, so don't bother looking for one...rely on Yelp!

Unfortunately, I MUST take away some stars because you will walk out smelling like the grill your food was cooked.  Why?  Good question.  The ventalation above the grill could use some attention.  It's not dirty like nasty, but dirty like it doesn't do it's job and it's easy to see.  

Don't let that keep you from going, I'll be back...it's a risk I'm willing to accept for great 4-star food.

Oh and PS...don't ask for them to make changes to what they offer.  Just deal with it! :)

Get that grill vent working properly and y'all will get my (coveted) 4th star!",2015-04-02 20:29:01

Also, I realize there may not be high demand for non-alcoholic beer, but for such a ""beer-y"" place, you'd think they'd stock at least one brand in bottles. I don't drink alcohol but enjoy sipping on a N/A beer occasionally, especially with a burger, and was disappointed to find they didn't have any. 

My official advice, it would be a good place to meet someone for a first date, or grab a beer after work in a much classier setting than some of the other bars on Main St. But if it's a burger you crave, head a little further north, save yourself $10, and get a charco cheeseburger from Northside Dairy Haven.",2017-05-26 11:08:00

We just moved to the area from Los Angeles, and everyone told us we had to try this place. We could definitely see why. It has a great atmosphere, and good food.

On ""Tenderloin Tuesdays"" you can pick any steak on the menu plus two sides for $15. Seemed like a good deal, so I ordered a New York strip steak with salad and green beans and my wife ordered the tenderloin with a salad and baked potato.

The service was good, but our food took for-ev-er to come. Like, pushing an hour and a half.

However, once it did come out, it was delicious. The cuts were great and mine was huge. The sides were tasty. (One of my pet peeves is when I go to a nice restaurant and the salad is obviously straight from a bag. This salad wasn't.) My steak was cooked a bit less than the medium I had ordered, but it was close enough for my taste.

Over-all our experience was very nice, and we'll definitely be back. (I have  a feeling I'll want to bump my rating up a star after another try.) We especially want to try their famous fried chicken!

EDIT: Second experience was similar, minus the long wait. Love this place!",2011-10-27 22:47:35

Well same service issues 3 months later. The food is ok at best. If your looking for exciting food with new flavor keep going. If you are in a hurry keep going. If you was an ok meal and are not in a hurry, stop by and you will find something that works. 

The bar needs some more training. When I ask for a drink on the rocks and it comes back frozed and the wrong drink, thats bad.

I went in for my very first tattoo a week ago, and I've been raving about them to anyone who'll listen ever since! First off, the shop is INCREDIBLY clean, not a wisp of dust to be found, from what I could see. It was nicely decorated, as well. I wanted to bring the couch home with me, it was so comfy! 
One thing to help y'all out, they don't do over the phone appointments. You need to have your deposit ready in order to schedule one, and they don't do plastic. They DO do walk ins as well,  I just hate waiting, and I knew I'd be nervous, so I HAD to schedule an appointment. While Greg was making up my drawing (stencil?), he asked several times if he had the spelling of my kids names correct. I remember him asking at least one other time while he was tattooing me. Before we sat down, he reminded me that I didn't have to get it all finished in one session, just in case I wussed out. We got me situated in the chair, and he got to work. I kid you not, I barely felt it! I was terrified that it was going to be excruciating pain, and it felt like someone was running their fingernail over my skin. during the whole session, we chatted back and forth, Greg kept making sure I was alright, and before I knew it, 2 hours had passed, and I was done! When I looked at mt new artwork in the mirror (it's on my shoulder), I almost cried. It was exactly what I had envisioned. The colors, placement, everything. I couldn't have hoped for a better first experience in body art! I'm already planning my next one, and it's only been a week, haha.  I would definitely recommend Underground to anyone.

Sam's said that in such situations the problem was usually that the astigmatism measurement was wrong.  My daughter called up Clarkson and they promised her the doctor would check her prescription on the Friday or Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend.  When my daughter went to Clarkson, they said the prescription matched the lenses in the sunglasses.  If my daughter was having problems with the prescription she had something seriously wrong with her eyes and needed a full examination.  Dr. Baker refused to see her and check the astigmatism.  We were forced to go and see the optometrist at Walmart and pay $58.  Sure enough, Mr. Todd said that the astigmatism measurement was off.  We took the corrected prescription to Sam's and they remade the glasses for free.  Problem solved thanks to Walmart Vision Center and Sam's.

There is a small ""L"" shaped waiting area, but they have wifi which is nice if there is a long wait.  You can request who cuts your hair on their online app, but I'd recommend you request a person 30 minutes before you intend to get there, and be aware of shift changes as that person might not be there if you take your time (it happens lol).  

Price is on par with other similar style chain haircut areas, so I was expecting the same quality and service.  As with any service industry job tipping is an integral part of the employee income (I make it a habit to tip well above and beyond if the service is truly deserving).  Sometimes they have coupons or sales on Facebook.  They have a military, firefighter, and police discount.    

But, this place has one of the best kept secret in the area, a quality hair cutter...er...stylist\barber, and I'm exposing it.  I've had my share of ""jacked"" up haircuts in various places and now that I've found someone to cut my hair the way I want it is a huge relief.  

I get my hair cut every other week by only one stylist, Mariana.  My family also gets their haircut with her.  She has the most outstanding customer service I've seen anywhere, managed my expectation and the haircut I want vs. what I can pull off lol, and a lot of life experience outside of the Midwest.  Makes for good topics of conversation.  Greeted with a smile and always an excellent haircut.

Much to our chagrin, they did NOT have much a selection at all in larger sizes.  So, thanks for letting us waste a trip (& gas money) to head out there.  The second reason for the lower grade is because, like too many other shops, there's just not much of a selection in available larger sizes to actually try on in the store (for bridesmaid dresses, anyway).

That being said, the sales ladies were very nice and the selections they did have available on the rack were all very nice looking--- on the hangers.  Really wish they would've had more than the one for my friend to try on, because the material that a couple styles of dresses were made out of was absolutely gorgeous...   Even though they were a bit pricier than other shops.  I would still recommend them to others.",2015-05-01 20:33:39

Let me start by saying that everyone that I've dealt with during this whole process,  was so very professional,  and pleasent, but a couple of them really shined bright. I called because the ""Granite Daddy"" commercials really grabbed my attention. But as a smart business man, I had to have as many estimates as possible. Money isn't  a factor in any of my decisions,  but like to know if anyone is to ""cheap"" or ""expensive"", because they are usually the ones to stay away from. Although RCG came in under everyone else,  it wasn't far from the average. I called the advertised number, and was greeted by the office girl Chandra, (sorry if that's wrong) and shortly after, "" The Granite Daddy"" himself called to set up our in home consultation. Now I can see why some may be rubbed wrong by Bob, but after talking with him a while, my gut, which is never wrong, pushed us forward, and we signed the contract. Bob's son Rob came out as scheduled for measure, spent a good hour or so double and triple checking his numbers, explained in detail the process to follow,  and left my wife and I feeling confident in our descision. The day of install was a bit different than explained, by the fact that Rob was to do the tearout, install, and reconnect of the plumbing, all in the same day. I wasn't quite sure that was possible, but again, felt comfortable after seeing how efficient the tearout went. So after carrying in the first couple pieces of granite, the other installer Joe (Bob's Grandson), pointed out a significant problem with the granite, and my heart sank in my chest, and I just knew this was going to be "" the too good to be true"" senario, and the job would not be completed in the time frame promised. A few minutes later, Rob came to me, explained where the problem occurred,  and offered a few solutions to fix it.. I told him I didn't care how he handled it, we were going out of town the following day, and we would really like it finished before we left. Rob told me not to worry, he would fix the problem on site, and have it finished regardless of how long it took. I swear it had to be the longest install ever, but in the end, it was 110% perfect. Rob and Joe spent hours installing, fixing, and reconnecting our plumbing, so when we left for vacation, we knew we'd be coming home to a beautiful kitchen. My hats off to everyone at River City Granite one of the best experiences we've ever had in home remodeling. . Thanks again

This little jewel of a place is less than a mile from my home,  yet I have never visited. I just got off work and was not in the mood to cook nor did I really want anything at home. I did a search on Yelp for nearby places and lo and behold this place popped up. I  looked at the pics and one caught my eye....I was instantly craving pizza when I saw it.  So I go in and was greeted right away. I showed the lady the pic and said I want this and only this...what is this!!! Lol She got a kick out of that. She told me it was their deluxe pizza on a hand-tossed crust. I ordered that with extra cheese. We chatted while I waited and I learned this was a local place that has three locations, customers are crazy about them, and the sauce on the pizza is a sweet sauce. 
I instantly panicked as I dont like sweet pizza sauce; however she put my mind at ease that it would be fine. 
I get home...I put this wonderful looking creation on my plate and as Im walking to sit down I impatiently took a bite........

This was everything to me! It was hot and the salty toppings balanced that sauce right on out. There was also a spiciness that most likelt came from the pepperoni.  

From here on out whenever I crave pizza I will be going here!!!!",2017-03-04 05:08:51

I was second in line to be seen but the wait time was nominal.  I was taken back where my vitals and medical history was take.  The nurse could not have been nicer, made me feel like I was important patient.

Once that was done, I had a short wait for the nurse-practitioner to come see me.  She was also courteous and professional.  She listen to my medical issue and was able to diagnose the issue.

So when I went to pick up my order the lady basically called me a liar when I said I already paid in full, but gave me my stuff anyway.

They are closed on Sunday, so don't try to pick up your dry cleaning when you are out on a Sunday afternoon.

I've never had a pair of slacks damaged in any way, the one time I had some funky creases in my slacks that should not have been there, they took them back and pressed them real quick while I waited.

We finally went last night and have never been more disappointed in a restaurant. As we were walking up to the front door, we overheard one couple leaving while stating ""literally the worst food ever"". When we walked in, there was no hostess and we were greeted by several drunken restaurant patrons who stated ""good luck getting service"" then laughed. We stood at the hostess stand for over five minutes before one patron at the bar noticed us and told the bartender that people were waiting The ""who appeared to be manager"" who we could see the whole time, finally set his coffee or latte down and came to greet us. While smacking gum, he sat us down and took our drink order. When the server brought our drinks they were completely wrong. After bringing us the correct drinks, we proceeded to order appetizers (meatballs and wings), the server had to return back to the table twice after ordering to ask us what sauce we wanted with the appetizers. At this time we could see the manager two tables over talking to another couple and giving them a refund for their poor experience. After that, we saw a drunken lady fall out of her seat and knock over several chairs. Not one employee approached the lady to check and see if she was alright. A few minutes later the server returned to take our dinner order, in which she stated they were out of both items we were ordering (meatloaf and chicken). At this point we told her to cancel our appetizers and decided to leave. The entire time, we could not figure out this ""identity crisis"" of a restaurant. Was it as restaurant, a sports bar, a social house or a club? The walls were bare, a random barn door hanging above the entrance, a jukebox, the noise was overwhelming, the number of easily observable intoxicated patrons were stumbling everywhere, and there were sports playing on all TV.

Immediately upon walking in we were greeted warmly by the receptionist and one of the artists who pointed us in the direction of another artist in shop that would work the best for the piece my cousin is wanting. He lost his dad last year and the tattoo is a memorial, so it is very important to him.

I have plenty of experience with tattoos and tattoo shops with over 14 tattoos of my own. I didn't want to take my never inked, naive cousin to the place that I frequent due to difference in art style and the edgier/harder atmosphere, so based on friends' experiences with Evermore and the clientele they usually receive (college town, locals, walk-ins) I thought this would be the perfect place for him. It totally is.

Cheese Nachos
Enchaladas Famosas
Burrito Jalisco

The lady on the phone was very nice, and said our food would be ready for pickup in 10 minutes (which was the first red flag).

I showed up 10 minutes later to pickup my food, and it was ready. The restaurant looked nice on the inside, but there were not many people there. I am not sure if that was because it was just past lunch time, or if people generally don't like the food (I am leaning toward the latter).

I drove right home to take the food to my family (I live extremely close to Zapata's).

The consensus was that everything was cold, soggy, and tasteless. It is hard to believe that something that was just made could be cold and soggy, but it was. It seemed like everything  was microwaved. The chicken and beef tasted like it was not seasoned at all. I had to add hot sauce to my food just to make it taste decent.

Good points:

Customer service
Speed
Price
Restaurant looks nice
Portions
Provided tortilla chips and salsa

Bad points:
Food was terrible on many levels

The hubby and I have gone numerous times, picking apples, strawberries and blackberries. The bounty we've picked has even been the topic of many of my blog posts and gluten-free food recipes I've made for the blog. We LOVE Eckert's. I was going to give it a beautiful 5-star. 

Then a few weeks ago I talked a group of my mom friends and their kids to come out and pick blackberries. We all had a blast and loved every second of it (and If at all interested in seeing the blog post on this picking adventure, here is the link... http://www.magpieatheart.com/back-to-the-blackberry-fields-we-go/). After rolling in and paying for our blackberries, we decided to give the restaurant a try. I am Celiac, and so is another Mom and her daughter. I had seen reviews and it mentioned on their online menu that they can accommodate gluten-free eating. Great! Perfect!! We all happily walked over to the restaurant at about 11:30am... and that's were the ""happy"" ended.

Perhaps we should have made a reservation? Perhaps it was six moms and six two year olds walking in to the restaurant that ""spooked"" the lady in charge of seating? But we were greeted by a grumpy and rather rude lady who said they really didn't have room at the moment and she'd have to ""see what she could do"" to seat a table of twelve. There were many empty tables at this point. But we all set our kids into their convenient kids play area and waited.

Ten minutes passed as we watched group after group that arrived after us be seated before us. Our very hungry kids were starting to get antsy so one of the group went up and told the seater that we were willing to break up into two or three table to be able to be seated sooner. I was not the one to go up so I'm unclear as to what exactly was said, but again, it wasn't friendly. 

Long story short, after standing there for twenty-five minutes without being seated we left. I would have loved to try the food here. All of us would have. But from the rudeness we were shown I don't think any one of us will be back. Poorly played, Eckert's Restaurant. Poorly played.",2014-08-10 20:33:16

I can usually find some really great deals toward the end of a season or find some random things that are priced lower than other places.

First of all, don't expect to walk into a high-end store with all the frillies. You'll find bargains here if you have the patience, young padawan.

Now to serious shopping business! One of my regular purchases from here is a triple-milled French lavender bath/shower soap because they usually have them for a much better price than what I can find online or from Nordstrom Rack. This specific store carries a good variety compared to the others and I normally come out with a few soaps so I don't have to come back very often. They also have great deals on salon brand shampoo and conditioner although if you are looking for specific ones, it could be a hit and miss. They have some facial cleanser for cheaper than what you could get them for from Beauty Brands which is wonderful. If I can get something for less, I definitely will! 

I have made several purchases from here including shoes, accessories, home necessities, clothing and have never been disappointed. I have been buying some food containers here for my lunches and they have awesome deals on those. I might replace all my old storage containers in a few more visits!  Some of the things here might be last season's but those would mostly be the shoes and clothing. As far as the home essentials and hair care products, I don't think they really go out of style.

My only issue is that this place is not so organized. Like I said, patience.",2015-08-25 20:29:25

I could tell that the rectangular hamburger patty was probably a frozen patty that is shipped to all stores, it lacked any real flavor which was a major letdown.

My sandwich looks great always and is presented fairly well for me.

The meat seems well prepped.  Good clean tasting food, never greasy to me, the Philly has a little bit of oil on it making a savory sandwich, but nothing terrible overwhelming, only great flavor.

The fries are the best.  You will get plenty of the fries and they are really good, I think they cut those fresh daily.  No frozen old taste, just clean and delicious.  If you don't want anything else get the fries!",2014-11-30 19:22:31

We met at the Golden Corral located at 1079 Collinsville Crossing Boulevard in Collinsville, IL.

It is one price for all you can swallow.  I started out slow . . . inquired with our friend Michael is they offered an orientation before you dive right in - no orientation really needed.  You get a plate and start the hunt!  They have nachos, tacos, breakfast foods, main courses like sirloin steak (even had a gentlemen cooking your meat for you), salads - did not try this area - and then dessert zone. 

Meatloaf was delicious and fresh . . . as was the thin crust pizza.  Mashed potatoes were warm and tasty as was the chocolate covered marshmellows on a stick - had seven of those.  It was a buffet, right?  The yeast rolls were fresh from the oven and with honey butter . . . VERY VERY VERY tasty.  

Will definately go again . . . just take it slow - none of my plates were full at all - and the fried chicken drum sticks were over-the-top mouth watering.

Staff is very friendly. $6 beer pitchers. Franzia wine $3.  Soda free refills. Separate room for parties. Lots of TV's.  Cardinal memorabilia on walls. 

Smithton is so fortunate to have a first class sports bar as the owner did an excellent job rebuilding after a terrible fire to the older place. All sorts of folks come here like golfers to celebration parties to just couples. 
Entertainment from bands at 9pm or so.

they also have a little bookshelf in the back that is called the abbey lending library - bring a book, borrow a book.... aw.

i ordered an italian soda ($2.35 including tax) and it's yummy.

I moved here from out of state and opted to go here because, well, first impression seemed like they were clean & organized. And when I asked a coworker from the area about it, he didn't go there, but said the Littlefields were pretty well known in the area as a ""dentist"" family.  
I have been here 4 times. Twice for annuals & twice for fillings.  Coming from prior dentist (in another state) I had a few ""watch"" areas.  
On my first appointment they told me one of my watch areas would need to be filled. Dr. Niflin (my spelling of her name is probably wrong) did the filling, on the spot, as it was small & quick. She did an excellent job. I was impressed with the technology the place used & the doctor & hygienists were very friendly & attentive. 
On my second annual, all my ""watch"" areas now needed to be done, I was told. For multiple years at my old dentist, these were watch areas that they said weren't getting any bigger, but regardless, a watch area will eventually need to be filled anyway (in my opinion).  Because they were on different sides of my mouth, they instructed me to do 2 different appointments so my whole mouth wasn't numbed at once.
Now for my low rating: for the first side, I had Dr. Littlefield.  Very nice, but nothing seemed to go right. The dam kept slipping, the filling wasn't setting right, the filing to get the filling to match my bite after - nothing. She tried hard & everything finished & seemed well.  When I went to floss before bed that night I found extra sensitivity between the two different locations that had the new fillings and a spot where 2 of my teeth had been cemented together (that weren't part of the work site). I figured after the filling the sensitivity to the spots was normal so I ignored it. After 3 days of trying at least 3 times a day, I was finally able to break the cement & get the floss between the 2 teeth. Seems normal again. But the sensitivity by the filling sites remained & when flossing those spots, the teeth were not even remotely close together anymore. I couldn't chew on that side without LARGE pieces of food falling in & causing pain. 
When I went back in for the one on the other side, I had Dr Niflin. I asked her about the sensitivity/pain/large space between the teeth now.  She recognized the teeth were further apart now than they were/should be, but said unless it was making me uncomfortable, it wasn't going to cause more damage/be bad.  She did the one filling, once again basically perfectly.
Since it wasn't going to hurt anything having the gap in my teeth (it is 2 spots back in molars), I figured I'd see how it went.  Alittle over a month later now, my gums are inflamed in those spots, bleeding at times, my mouth hurts, and if it wasn't obvious I can't chew on that side without something stabbing my gums there. I think even some of my gums there has died & fallen off (or in dental terms recessed) making my molars feel slightly ""loose"". All this literally happened within like a day recently (the very bad gum stuff). I have been diligent in my dental care, so that is not the reason. In fact, the spacing is so far apart now, that before the work, I could barely get floss in, now the spacing is so far that the floss doesn't even work & I've had to use a finger to take the large pieces of food out that flossing, brushing, & mouthwash leave behind.
I was actually on here, yelp, to find a new dentist to fix me so my mouth isn't in pain. If it was just one thing, yes, we're human, we do make mistakes/not perfect. But this was both places she went in my mouth are now bad & even a place right next to it! (And there's filling crud stuck on my teeth yet so they're no longer smooth). That's all more than one little mistake, which I'd understand.  
If you do go here, just make sure you have Dr Niflin, she's good.  I'd avoid the other doctor. And the office in General is very clean & nice. I just worry about the competency based on my experience.... (I feel very bad writing this, but it is truly how I feel, and how annoying/bad my mouth feels.)",2014-08-15 17:18:27

So much so that I grabbed my kitchen scale only to find that one sandwich had 2.3 Oz of meat and the other had 1.9 ounces of meat.  That made me wonder just how much beef there is supposed to be.  Now, the Hardee's site has no information on the amount of beef, just a total calorie count and nutritional breakdown of the total sandwich.  But I did find a couple calorie counter sites that did give the info with a breakdown.
According to those reports the Big Roast Beef has 85 grams of beef, but upon doing the math 85 grams comes to roughly 2.99 ounces!  So, get with it Hardee's and ensure better quality...oh yeah, that au jus that's advertised was completely missing!  Dry as a bone paltry sandwich!",2020-11-06 19:49:51

The ladies in the office were great, helpful and informative, as well as very personable. The optometrist there was wonderful.He was patient during the exam, didn't rush and made sure to give my eyes small breaks in between to keep my eyes from overstraining while figiring out the correct eye script.

Okay....we go there, and I told the man behind the counter, we want to go to the Playland.....and he acted like I was speaking Russian or something. 
He asked me.....
Are you a member? 
No. I just called here and I was told I didn't have to be a member. 
Well you can't just leave your kids here, we're not a daycare.
Why would I leave them here? 
So then he ask this other dude. 
What do you say? How do you want to handle this?
And he's like.....
Well kids are $3 and everyone has to pay.
So its $3 each?
Oh no no.....you guys need a 7 day pass, which is $15 each.

Why is it, that when I called there I was told one story. Now that I'm in front of you, it's something else. They were making up stuff as they went along. What is you policy. Why doesn't it say membership required for children to play in the Playland area on the flyer? What pissed me off even more was how hurt my son was because he didn't understand why we were leaving. The two men were extreme rude and snobby. And I hate to bring race into it, but that's what it felt like. Why would I think a gym is a daycare? Why would I leave my 3 year old and 1 year old with strangers? For him to even say something like that, made me mad. Terrible customer service. One of them main reason I brought my kids there or even considered going there was because I'm tired of taking my kids to the mall to play in the little area there. And it's not like it was a great play area....it was the same play equipment that they have at Chick -fil-a, and McDonald's. I'm trying to keep my kids from eating fast food. So if I can get the same experience from a place like a gym, and promote healthy, fun activities for my kids, I'll gladly pay for that.

Later found out from my primary dr, that the dr from Anderson Express Care told them my ankle was not broken. So my primary dr had me go to physical therapy! When I told the Physical therapist what happened, he said only a very few are that bad. Then he looked at mine. He was shocked how disfigured and still heavily swollen it was and deeply bruised all over. They did minimal work on me since it was still so injured. After a couple of months I went back to my primary dr saying it is not getting better. She just said pretty much that we don't need to x-ray it again because Anderson Express Care dr already said it wasn't broken. Back to more physical therapy. A few months later of no improvement I went back and pretty much demanded to be seen by a specialist.  Got an appointment with a foot/ankle specialist. He took one look at it and sent me for x-rays. He came back and said, ""Your ankle is broken! Why in the world have you been going to physical therapy and trying to walk on it!! And you tore all the ligaments and tendons at the same time.

They diagnose the issue as a bad wheel bearing and make the replacement. I sign the paperwork, make the payment and leave. On the way home, the sound returns. I bring it back and they claim they fixed it by trying some other things such as re-torquing the parts and/or filling the differential fluid. This process of me leaving and returning goes on for about 3 or 4 more times that day until they eventually claim the new bearing they installed is ""bad"" as they've had similar issues with other Ford (I have a Lincoln, which is made by Ford) customers, so they need to order a new bearing to install which will be available Monday. Before I leave, I ask what happens if this doesn't fix it to which the advisor, Joe, tells me he will partner with his GM to issue a refund.

I work about 40 miles from my home, so I take Monday off to deal with this based on how much of my Saturday I spent there. I go there and they do the install of the second new wheel bearing. The sound stops... until Tuesday morning.

On Tuesday morning, the sound comes back on the way to work as loud as it was normally. Once I get to work, I call up Joe at the Meineke and tell him it's back. He tells me to come back in. My boss lets me off a little early so I can get there since they close at 6 PM. So I get there around 3:45 PM or so. They test drive it and then have me drive it around with one of their technicians in the back seat. It took a little for the sound to come back but the technician told me he could hear it and we could go back to the shop to take a look. After awhile, Joe and another gentleman come in (I think his name was Adam), and tell me they can't find anything mechanically wrong with the car and that they're not hearing the sound. He also then proceeds to, conflictingly, tell me the the guy who rode with me thinks the sound might be coming from the speaker? The sound system wasn't even on. The sound does not sound like an electrical short or something. Joe then tells me they can't provide me a refund and that they also changed out the brake pads and rotor (which is indicative that they even stopped believing it was the wheel bearing that they charged me for) and to sign some new paperwork agreeing to this. I signed nothing and told them I want my money back, and they don't budge but suggest I get a ""second opinion"".

The next morning, I recorded a video of myself going to the gas station before work with the sound coming back as proof it exists of which I still have the video.

I took it to the Ford dealership near my work and they heard the sound. They claimed it was being caused by the heat shield rubbing against my rear driveshaft and re-tightened it. I contact the shop and speak to Adam (the guy from before) as Joe was not in and tell them of the dealership's findings and to start my refund. He said he would talk to Joe and they would contact me tomorrow. Well, it's now 5:04 PM on ""tomorrow"" and they closed at 4 PM. Radio silence.

I want my money back.",2019-07-13 22:12:00

The glass-half-full crowd would think it's quaint; they're proud of their heritage and the history of their town, etc.  For us cynics, it's hard not to wonder if a bunch of nazi war criminals found a refuge right here in Illinois farm country.  I saw a collection of old Mercedes by the garage.

Such is life in post-911 America, I guess.  Any chance to be suspicious, I jump on it.    

The people at Dreamland Palace were very nice, and this place definitely reminded me of some of the restaurants I visited in Germany.  The soundtrack was probably ""Live From the Hofbrau Haus"" and really made the scene complete.  The other thing we loved here was the beer - huge glasses of hefeweisen on draft and a nice selection of bottle beer, too.  Our favorite was the Paulaner Dubbel Bock. 

For an appetizer, we had something called brat bites, or something like that.  They were deep fried pieces of bratwurst and came with some brown mustard.  They were good, but please don't tell my doctor I had them.   For entrees we ordered Jaegerschnitzel, breaded veal with a mushroom gravy and something called Black Forest Schnitzel, which I don't recall seeing in Germany; chicken with ham and swiss on top.  For sides, we had potato pancakes, German potato salad, green beans and red cabbage.  You got to go through the salad bar before your meal, which reminded me very much of dishes you might find at the Hometown Buffet.  Definitely no seconds.  Probably the best things were the chicken and potato pancakes.  The rest was just okay.  The aren't a lot of German restaurants in the St. Louis area, but I don't think there's really a need to drive way out here for a fix.  

To summarize:  Great beer, okay food, very authentic German atmosphere and friendly service.",2013-01-28 17:04:48

It's a nice property, well suited for business travel or an overnight stay with the family.  The lobby and other communal areas are modern, clean, and stylish.  The staff is friendly and efficient.  The rooms are well appointed and comfortable.  The bar is welcoming and well provisioned.  But I had two problems that obviate a 4 or 5 star review:

1) There was, what appeared to be, a fresh stain on the fitted bed sheet, and the sheets were very wrinkled, as if they hadn't been changed after the last guest. I slept in the other, non-stained bed. Major problems with that.

2) 2 of the 4 treadmills were not functional.  Why have them if they are going to collect dust?

All in all, a nice place.  And if you don't want to dine captively, there are plenty of restaurants in the immediate vicinity.",2011-07-28 16:08:41

They always come back with the honest answer.  Here's an example.  I bought a used car and the A/C made a funny sound.  I took it back to the dealer and they said it was the blower.  They wouldn't cover it under warranty, but offered to fix it for me and gave me an estimate.  I took it to Pro Automotive for a second opinion, and their price to replace the blower was much better.  Turns out the blower was fine, just filled with acorns.  (Acorns!?!?)  They fixed it for a small fraction of the original estimate.  They could have just replaced the blower and I'd never have known, but they were honest.  Even though it cost them some money.

We're talking the type where you say to your friend ""now I know that I asked for skim milk, but this tastes WAAAY too good to be nonfat!!"" I love it when that happens :D (side note: I used to say that about Panera's Carmel Latte until I realized the reason it was so amazing even with skim milk was because the syrup is creamy and buttery... thus entering the yummy fat count...) 

Nice little coffee shop. Comfy spots to sit with your friends and have a chat. Seemed clean. Lots of syrups and bakery goods to choose from. My friend had the cinnamon bun and yes it was huge! I expected it to be hard and not very good, but it was great! I had one bite and I secretly wanted to steal the rest from her plate. I had the zucchini bread and the banana nut bread. Tasty! Though for the first time in my life, I think I liked banana nut bread better. I think the crispy crust on the zucchini bread was throwing me for a loop. I'm used to it being very soft. 

I had lattes both times. First time was a nonfat latte: I felt like I tasted a little bit of nuttiness to it. I'm a fan of that, so I was impressed. Second time I had a nonfat latte with toasted marshmallow syrup: Now... is there cream in that? because my nonfat latte tasted too good to be true. I tell you what, next time I'm going to stand there and WATCH the person and see what milk they use. I must know. 

I like that they had so many cookies, pastries and wrapped caramels to choose from. I love options. 

Was a little sad that they close at 8pm on a weekday... but I suppose it makes sense for the area. It's in a business district where all the other shops and businesses have closed. Well, minus any bars that happen to be around.",2010-08-20 23:21:34

Stopped in one night for a late dinner - ordered salad, cheese fries & zucchini to share. My salad came out DRENCHED in ranch dressing. It was literally spilling over the sides and dressing plopped into my water cup as the waitress handed the plate to me. Both her & I had to wipe off our hands after we handled the plate. I didn't finish the salad because I felt like all I was eating was ranch. The other items I got were good! Crispy zucchini sticks & fries can't really mess those up.

Will definitely try this place out if I'm in the area again looking for a meal. But this time I'm asking for my dressing on the side.

This location specifically is already even worse than the first few times we shopped there, in August 2017. 

We hadn't been back except to pick up orders. We went in today and egads it is even worse than a flea market on the bad side of a town. There is too much merchandise scattered all over the place, you can barely navigate the aisles for all the badly jumbled clothing. The music is too loud and it is the worst versions of songs that were pretty bad to begin with.

Today's insult was an abandoned pick-up desk. After standing there for 15 minutes a sullen, spoiled entitled teenager came over.  She was rude and ""put upon"", basically treated me, an adult paying customer-like a kid at school she didn't need to pay attention to. 

I tried to contact the store to express my concerns, no answer.  I tried to reach corporate- no way to do so.  The store clearing only cares about sales and though their webpage professes customer service as a core value-nothing I saw today puts that on the list at all. 

This location is doomed. We likely leave the area by 2020.  I'm not sure this one will still be open by then. I guess I will pay for delivery to the house, rather than deal with spoiled teens who don't appreciate that they have a job.

Still can't say this is my favorite place to go.  I have been to Big Daddys in St. Louis, they have crowds, and literate people who speak in complete sentences.   

Walking in at 10pm, I notice not 1, not 2, but 3 police cars out front.  For a sleepy little Mayberry-esque town like Belleville that seems excessive!  One asshat cop was waiting parked outside looking to give DUIs.  They must have stiffed him his bribe (er....... on duty adult libation ;-) ),  

I got here kinda late to meet some friends.  They insisted on the place.  I let them know there are literally a dozen better places within walking distance!  Like places where people have real teeth?

I think this bar supports AA meetings, because this is a good place to sober up.  Despite a very small crowd for a Saturday night, it took forever to get served.  I was waiting for these two lawn gnomes to finish debating in Latin the merits of various alcoholic additions to their Red Bull, when I decided it would be rude to reach over them and order a bottle of Bud.  Although I was tempted.  

After reviewing the inhabitants at Big Daddy's I came to the conclusion that this is the closest I will come to the cantina scene in Star Wars.  

I drank beer, because I was afraid of the local water supply!

This place does cater to a certain clientele and I guess they don't come for the food.",2016-02-13 02:55:20

We recently purchased a used car from Federico KIA.  When we picked up the car there was only one key.  We asked for, and were promised a second key.  They now refuse to produce the key.  We have escalated through their management and are currently working through the Better Business Bureau, but still the resist.

Background - The car purchased is a Smart car.  The salesperson requested we return to Federico KIA, a 70 mile trip, on a Friday when their key vendor is available.  We agreed, with the stipulation, agreed to by the salesperson, that if their vendor could not produce the key, Federico KIA would pay for a key made by a Smart dealer.  Their vendor was unable to make the key and Federico KIA now refuses to pay for a key from the Smart dealer.

Buyer beware!

Every time I walk in everybody is happy both customers and employees regardless if it's busy or slow. Note: It was only slow ones on the holiday weekend. The food is incredible I've never had anything bad. The French toast is probably one of the best I've ever had and I highly suggest you order it without sugar and blueberries because the flavor of the toast is phenomenal. My favorite is the sausage and cheese omelette it is huge it is cooked to order and it's served perfect. They also do their hashbrowns right I like need a double order I think every time I go because they cook them to perfection. These people deserve our business.

Finding Dr. Gundersen was one of the best things I've done for myself. Dr. Gundersen is right there beside you every step of your path-- whatever path you're on. He's one of those doctors that actually listens to you, and what's more-- he hears you; he's always asking how you are, how you feel, what you want to do. And he supports you, advises you, moves WITH you. Here, you are cared for. And you know it. This is not an office where you're an anonymous number on a long roster of clientele. It feels like every single person on the team is working for YOU, making sure you feel comfortable, making sure you are okay. 

So from the above and beyond customer service reps, to the call center (who address me personally), to the layout of the actual building and energy/ambience of the offices, and most importantly, to Dr. Gundersen himself--this place dedicates an exceptional amount of attention to the PATIENT'S comfort and satisfaction. You feel taken care of to a level that you can't find at every office or with every doctor.

With Dr. Gundersen, you just know that you're not alone. You've found someone who is just as concerned with your mental health as you are. And that is seriously rare. The first time I walked out of this office, I knew I had someone on MY team who made sure I was confident in every step of my own mental health treatment and journey.

The place looked as clean as it gets but didn't seem the most inviting, very dull interior. The service wasn't great, the kid working there barely spoke a word and didn't even tell me he was setting the ""iced coffee"" out with half and half and milk to make myself, I just had to assume that was for me to make myself. Had I known that I wouldn't have ordered it.

Now onto the important part, the yogurt, the flavors I thought had an ok variety depending on what your looking for. The cake batter and the cookies and cream weren't bad. Most of the flavors seemed to be for those less adventurous. The mint was terrible, it tasted like I was eating tooth paste.

The food was good, if not a bit pricey for typical Tex-Mex. I got a combo pork verde enchilada and mini chimichanga. Both were pretty good. I wish the verde had a little more bite, but I like it on the spicy side. Girlfriend had the chicken fajita. Unfortunately the meat was a little dry/tasteless.

Staff was nice. Our original room was facing the highway and we heard the whoosh of the passing cars, so the staff was helpful in that they moved us and were quick and accommodating. Our new room was okay, but THE DOORS ARE SO LOUD WHEN PEOPLE CLOSE THEM.  They would make large BOOM sounds when people would close them, so imagine trying to sleep in the morning with that. 

WiFi was $2.99 per device for a day, so no free WiFi here...

Also, we heard noise from the room above us and random sounds at night (which weren't amorous, thank God).  I understand that the price of less than $50 per night (at least for us when we stayed) should be considered when writing a review, but when a person is awoken by slamming doors, that's a problem.  I did my own test and let our room door shut ""normally"", and I was treated to another loud sound. 

Long story short, this hotel looks nice and modern, but it's just too noisy here in terms of the rooms and slamming doors, IMO.  

I wouldn't return here.",2017-12-29 14:08:33

You're supposed to park in the back lot. This lot is only for Medical use."" He then asked "" did you make an order?"" I said I had not because I had questions but I need an answer before I made a decision and he rolled his eyes "" you don't know nothing about these products??"" And I said ""No, it's not been legal until recently"". He told me to go online and educate myself. I told him ""I have been reading online but still had questions"" he kept interrupting me when I was trying to tell him the problems I had attempting to call the store. He sounded disgusted that I had the audacity to call "" well we're really busy and we don't have time to have someone answer the phone"". I asked him ""what about people who drive really far to come here?"" He just rolled his eyes and shook his head again.

He also told me that if I want to find out about the products, I should just buy something small to try. I know this was probably rude of me but I replied ""Or I'll just go somewhere else""

You could enter to have your hot rod or muscle car in the Power Tour, or you could be a spectator.  Either way, you get to park your car inside the drag strip for a car show.  People come from all over to show off the hard work they did on their vintage vehicles, and then many follow the tour from town to town through a few different states.  It's usually a week long event, but we only came for the one day.

I never imagined being in this area of IL twice times within the same year, but we were, and had a great time. 

P.S. - If you're staying in the area, there's a delicious pizza place in Edwardsville called Peel Wood Fired Pizza.  And there's a delicious burger place called Swingers in Normal, IL.

As I had heard good things about Foley & it was close to home, I made an apt with them. One of the worst mistakes of my life.

According to them, I needed a re-do root canal, several crowns replaced, a tooth extracted & bone graft, 2 implants and braces!!!  

I was charged $235.00 for a Periodontist consult.  I was told that if I didn't have the implants, that $180.00 would be refunded.  I decided to wait on the implants, but do the extraction/bone graft. Originally the $180.00 was applied toward the extraction, which was fine & I actually had a balance due me.  The day of the extraction, I was told that not only did I owe an additional $80.00 for anesthesia, that they had forgotten to charge me,  but also the $180.00 because the other $180.00 was for the consult/xray. 

After I said no, I was told that the $180.00 would be refunded if I didn't have the implants, they said fine & that it would be waived.  I paid the additional for the anesthesia and had the procedure.  Three months later, I received a bill for the difference between what they owed me and the $180.00 saying payment was due immediately.

This wasn't the 1st billing issue I'd had with this office either.  They constantly misquoted a price or ""forgot"" to charge for a service/fee. Every time I walked in the office for an appt. they would tell me I owed more for some reason (never showed me a bill or a reason in writing).  

I terminated my relationship with this practice & have sought the opinions of 2 other reputable practices in the area. Both of these practices did the consults for free, including state of the art xrays, gum evaluations & biopsies for ca. Both practices have said that I do not need any more crowns replaced, that I don't need braces and if I hadn't let Foley's practice extract my tooth, I wouldn't need the implants either.",2016-12-04 02:42:13

My sons take their Fitness Heroes class and today I took all three of my kids to their Open Gym. The facility is great. Lots of cool things to do. Unfortunately, my boys don't like the class they're in. A lot of time is spent on stretching and warming up....seriously. It's a 55 minute class and they warm up for a solid 35 to 40 minutes of it. My boys want to be on the equipment. Who wouldn't? They get very little time on it.
Also, the coaches seem like they'd benefit from a little background in age appropriate expectations. The day my boys decided they hate the class--a day they left class in tears--was when they were taken to the gymnastics gym as a class and given directions for a 7 or 8 part circuit. My boys are 6 and 9. They, and every other kid, could only hold onto two or three of the instructions. So they started in and when the fourth obstacle came, they did it wrong...because kids that age can't remember that many steps!! And for getting it wrong, they were yelled at and shamed in front of the class. They received this because they were at the start of the line. No one else knew what to do either.
I've noticed they don't go in that gym anymore. Still, that shaming did my boys in. They're very good boys who aren't used to being yelled at by a coach in that angry manner. It ruined the class for them. We're sticking it out to the end of the session, but no more after that.
Also, we went to Open Gym today because they always complain about not getting time on the equipment. I also brought my daughter. They only had the gymnastics side open for a long time. My daughter, who has issues with anxiety among other things, finally tried some equipment. Every time she got up the nerve to try something, she was told she was too old for it (she's 11 and supposedly allowed at Open Gym). The obstacle course, the bars, the trampoline.... Each time she was so embarrassed for being admonished. There were no signs indicating age and they didn't tell us going in, so she couldn't have known. This left her with almost nothing to do in the only gym they had open. With about 50 minutes left in Open Gym, they finally opened up the other gym. She went in and tried some stuff, but after a bit she found herself in trouble for other unknown rules....don't step on a mat, don't walk on that in that direction, don't go on that until you show us you can do x, y, and z. She finally gave up. 
Oh, and she was told she couldn't go on stuff without her hair up (which, if it's a rule, fine), but at least THREE other girls were doing everything with their hair down and yet, my daughter gets spoken to about it twice (the first time they gave her permission with some stipulations).

So, my older son had a great time once they opened the Fitness Heroes gym. My younger son was less than thrilled and my daughter was incredibly discouraged.

So, I cannot recommend their classes and I can recommend their Open Gym with certain stipulations....make sure, before you go, that they'll actually have both gyms open--especially if your child is over 8. And don't bring a kid who get nervous when y",2016-10-10 20:34:43

Dealer had quoted $1500 for the muffler repair. Other similar shops quoted $250.

Went in spoke with Cody and received a $175 quote  and they could have done in 2 hours.

Work is warrantied for a year. Was completed in 1 hour and within quote. 

I wasn't pressured to purchase needless products. And their assessment of the issue was the same as the dealer and other shops. They were just able to replace the muffler without the expense of replacing the entire exhaust.

I will update if any issues arise. But I was satisfied with the service and the experience.",2018-05-19 17:45:45

I even thought to myself that I would be sure to come back to this one. The place was doing a good amount of business.
I ordered an egg white and cheese flatbread. The young man who made it was delayed a bit as he tried to find the eggs. They clearly weren't where he expected in the full (closed) refrigerator....this isn't my first egg white and cheese....I see where they're usually kept. Another employee pointed out to him that the eggs are now kept in a new spot. It was up on the counter near the condiments. Odd spot. He took one and proceeded to make my order.
I wish I'd given more thought to the fact that they've started keeping their eggs out where it's ""chilled"" a bit and not in a cold fridge.
Nope. Bad move.
I later became violently ill. Vomiting, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain, headache, chills. Food poisoning!!!
That egg was the only possible culprit, as nothing else I'd had at any point was capable of causing food poisoning. And it wasn't a bug, because I can't keep my kids away from me even while sick and they are all perfectly healthy. Plus given the timing, symptoms, and duration....it was the egg.
I actually had to postpone an important medical test scheduled for the following day because of this.

I haven't had Little Caesars pizza in a while, but I'm glad I took my friends advice,and gave them another chance. The pizza we get from Little Caesars now is head and shoulders above what they used to serve, and far better than any other chain pizza place in the area (Pizza Hut, Dominoes, Papa John's).

My wife and I started getting little Caesars when they started offering their pretzel crust pizza. If you want a delicious savory pizza with buttery crust, look no further-this stuff is seriously the bomb!

We decided to also give little Caesars deep dish (Detroit style) pizza a try when they came out with that since Pizza Hut's deep dish is not the same as it used to be (and since we liked the pretzel crust so much) and it did not disappoint. The employee said they use olive oil to make the pizza, but I don't know how you can get such a buttery tasting crust with olive oil, and frankly I don't care. The pizzas are always cooked to perfection (crunchy on the bottom without being burnt, and soft in the middle without being doughy). 

Our new favorite (and ""cheat day"") pizza is the nine dollar ""Detroit style"" box special [1 pepperoni deep dish,1 garlic cheese deep dish]. You get so much pizza that we have enough left for the next day! For nine bucks! You will have a hard time finding a better pizza for the price, and even many expensive pizza places can't compete with little Caesars new offerings.

The only drawback we have experienced at the Fairview Heights store is that the owners tend to under staff the restaurant. The workers work their behind off, so be patient with them because it's not their fault the owner doesn't want to shell out a couple more bucks to adequately staff the restaurant. Other than that I have no complaints with Fairview Heights Little Caesars.

I'm waiting for my wife to get back from little Caesars right now *stomach growls*as Saturday is cheat day in our house, and little Caesars nine dollar box special is on the menu! Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to one today. I guarantee you won't be sorry!",2015-09-26 17:54:40

At the time, it was the only place that we could realistically go to on a regular basis, so we put up with their nonsense for almost a year.  Now before I go into detail, I think it's important to clarify that these people are DOCTORS.  They're tasked with treating a wide variety of mental illnesses; they hold their patients' mental health in their hands.  This is why I am so appalled by the way their business is run.  A kid messes up my sandwich?  No big deal.  A store charges my card twice for one purchase?  It sucks, but it'll get fixed and I'll live.  My wife's mental health suffers due to incompetent staff?  Unbelievable.

First, let's address actually GETTING an appointment here.  You'll want to start by calling...  Just don't call at any time in the middle of the day, as it appears both people at the front desk take lunch at the same time for a 5-hour period.  Don't bother leaving a message, they won't call back.  Just keep calling until you finally get a hold of someone, who will schedule your first visit for next month.  

A month goes by and you go to your appointment, arriving 15 minutes early to take care of any paperwork.  After an hour of waiting with no explanation, you finally meet with your therapist/psychiatrist (in my wife's case, she needed to see both, which doubled the amount of painful visits), who will try their hardest to get you out the door as soon as possible.  Wonderful, isn't it?  I understand that the average psychiatrist appointment is short due to the nature of their job, but they have no right to cut the hour-long therapy sessions we paid for short.  But hey, if anything major comes up that you couldn't cover in your session, ""you can call me directly any time""...  Lies.  

First, read up a couple paragraphs and you'll see how difficult it is to get a hold of the office.  The doctor won't answer their cell.  The front desk won't answer their phones.  If they do, they will forward you to a voicemail so you can ""leave a message for the doctor"", and that message will never be returned.  How can they do this?  Seriously...  How can someone sit there, listen to some crying over the phone begging for help, and just decide to never respond?  What kind of sick individuals would do this?  Okay okay, I exaggerate a bit...  No one is sitting there ignoring cries for help.  They're just ignoring the messages entirely.  My wife tried to call them as instructed whenever something came up, and after a few months the voice mailbox was full, never to be emptied.

So I bet you're thinking, ""These doctors must suck!"" right?  Well, to be honest, not entirely...  This is actually where it just gets weird.  When we first went there, both the therapist and psychiatrist seemed kind and knowledgeable, but seemed to be struggling to work around ITIC's poor management.   If put in a professional environment in which the staff answered the phones, properly relayed messages, and staggered appointments in a way that prevented significant overlap, I imagine they would do quite well.  Too bad...  But I did say it gets weird, didn't I?  My wife's therapist disappeared...  No, I'm not making this up.  She just disappeared.  When we went to our appointment, they informed us that she simply never came back from vacation and they couldn't make contact with her (note that they didn't call and tell us BEFORE I took time off work to drive down to the office...).  Similarly, my wife's psychiatrist simply up and retired with no prior notice given to the office or his patients.  I think this shows just how little he cared for the people that relied on him.  

The final straw was the replacement psychiatrist...  A patronizing, forgetful woman of dubious intellect.  I don't know how she got the job, but after several visits in which she literally did not remember my wife and was unfamiliar with the medicines she had been taking, we called it quits.

Ultimately, I feel this place did more harm than good to my wife's mental health.  We both agree that since seeking help elsewhere, everything has been so much better.

The building is new and the staff was nice, but otherwise they seem to be struggling with the workload.

The breakfast attendant has trouble keeping up with refilling food and supplies. At one point the plasticware was just sitting in cardboard boxes on the counter because they were too overwhelmed to keep up. Despite being new, everything is a little dirty. Your shoes stick to the floor when you walk. Rotting pizza and chicken had overflowed the outside trash can and was left for two days before being emptied. There is still a soda bottle on the ground right in front of the door.

The ceiling in our bathroom is cracking and falling down and the hardware is rusting already. The finishes are contemporary and new, but there's clearly a quality and upkeep issue.

They also incorrectly told us they allowed pets when they do not. I called and spoke with the front desk before booking to make sure pets were allowed. I even asked about the pet fee and was told $50. I double checked because that is much lower than most hotels and the front desk confirmed that yes dogs are allowed and the fee is only $50.

I then called back after I booked through the Marriott app to confirm and have the reservation noted so we would be charged the pet fee. The woman said she noted the reservation and never mentioned pets weren't allowed. At check in no one said anything despite the fact that we carried dog beds and walked two dogs down the hallway.

When the staff did eventually address the dogs they locked us out of our room instead of simply calling us. They had both our cell phones and our room number to call. At anytime they could have easily called and talked to us. Instead they locked us out of our room and said they ""caught us"" with dogs on the security camera, as if we did something wrong.

They agreed to let us stay, but only as a courtesy because we were Marriott members and not because they made a mistake. The tone was as if we did something wrong but they were being kind in overlooking it. No one cared we were 1,000 miles from home and worried about a place to sleep because they gave us wrong information. No one attempted to apologize or take responsibility. The manager wouldn't even speak to us. All the information was relayed through the front desk.

The remainder of the stay has been strained and stressful. The staff hasn't so much as nodded our way, apolized, or checked on us. This whole ordeal has turned what should have been a nice family trip into a really uncomfortable situation.",2018-05-29 01:27:45

They also have a pretty extensive snack bar, plus an assortment of beer, a hard cider, and Bud Margaritas. All reasonably priced.

The music is too, for want of a better term, urban nightclub. Not conducive for conversation or for enjoying a leisurely meal.

The service used to be amateur but friendly. Now it's gothy and terse.

The prices have gone way up. Rolls that were $10.50 are now $12, old price $7 now $9. But the nigiri-style has literally doubled - the price that used to get you two pieces now gets you one. So $63 later, we were still a little hungry. Everything was plenty tasty, just not much of it for the dollars.

The homey touches like actual Kikkoman bottles, Kirin beer glasses and unique little earthenware dishes have been replaced with confusing salad dressing bottles (seriously, the staff was even annoyed by them), standard glassware and sterile white ceramic squares.

Kinda like the place went a little bit upscale emo.

So I don't know that we'll be back. Maybe we'll win the lotto and then order take-out so we can take our time without the annoying music and hurried service.",2012-05-29 02:12:54

They're almost always faster than expected! Only one time did we run into an interesting situation. I stood near the picture window to watch because my fur baby is a bit of a jackass and like to run out the front door. Yes, only the front, so once the tracker said the delivery was on its way, I went to watch. The driver came the wrong way through the cul-de-sac and sat in front of my house for a good 2-3 minutes and left. He didn't come back for another 10-15 minutes. By then our food was lukewarm but we were starving. I can honestly say that this has only occurred once. Every other time, our order has been piping hot--literally right out of the oven. Everything has been delivered accurately and on time (usually early!) Every business can have an off day. It happens. Humans are involved in the process. For me, it's more about how they fix a mistake rather than holding them to a standard of never making them. You won't find constant mistakes here. They're few and far between. I have to say, when I allow myself to order pizza, the Wisconsin Six Cheese is ridiculous!! It's so good. The Mediterranean Veggie sub is so good, and my family loves the Brooklyn crust. The new Parmesan bites are killer. Possibly literally because they're doused in butter, but on an indulgence night...mmm holy delicious!",2014-05-09 00:44:50
