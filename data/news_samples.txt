Dozens, if not more than a hundred, Midland-area residents gathered to seek refuge within the walls of Midland High School Tuesday night after the Edenville Dam failed to hold back a deluge of water. Midland officials warned residents living near the Tittabawassee River to evacuate. They are concerned the Sanford Dam, located a few miles northwest of the city and downstream of the Edenville Dam, will also fail. Some drove to the school at 1301 Eastlawn Drive to seek shelter. Others were brought in by bus.
Videos and images captured by witnesses show just how much water was unleashed when Michigan's Edenville Dam failed. Officials had been warning nearby residents to evacuate all day Tuesday because of fears the hydroelectric dam holding back Wixom Lake would break. It was announced on Facebook around 6 p.m. Tuesday that the dam had failed -- and a torrent of water was rushing down the Tittabawassee River. The water's unrelenting flow continued overnight and daylight on Wednesday showed how little was left of the lake. An aerial image taken by a drone shows the Edenville dam breach on Wednesday.
Soaking rains from the remnants of Hurricane Ida prompted the evacuations of thousands of people Wednesday after water reached dangerous levels at a dam near Johnstown, PA. The storm moved east in the evening, with the National Weather Service confirming at least one tornado and social media posts showing homes blown to rubble and roofs torn from buildings in a southern New Jersey county just outside Philadelphia. Pennsylvania was blanketed with rain after high water drove some from their homes in Maryland and Virginia. The storm killed one person, two people were not accounted for, and a tornado was believed to have touched down along the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. Ida caused countless school and business closures in Pennsylvania. About 150 roadways maintained by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation were closed and many smaller roadways also were impassable.
